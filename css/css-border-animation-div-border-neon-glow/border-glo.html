    <!-- This is our main container. We're using Tailwind classes to center everything on the page
         and give the body a dark background for that cool glowing effect later. -->

        <!-- This is the star of the show â€“ our div that will get the glowing border!
             'relative' is important because our glowing border (which will be a pseudo-element)
             will be positioned absolutely relative to this div.
             'w-80 h-48' sets its size, 'bg-gray-800' gives it a dark background,
             'rounded-xl' makes the corners nice and smooth, and 'overflow-hidden'
             is crucial to keep the glowing border contained within its rounded edges. -->

        <h1 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold z-10">Hello Glow!</h1>
        <!-- Just some text inside our div to make it look like a real content box.
             'z-10' makes sure our text stays on top of the glowing border effect. -->
