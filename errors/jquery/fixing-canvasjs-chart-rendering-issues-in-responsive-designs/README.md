# üêû Fixing CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in Responsive Designs


This document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating CanvasJS charts into responsive web designs: the chart failing to resize or render correctly when the browser window is resized or the viewport changes (e.g., on mobile devices). This often manifests as a chart that remains at its initial size, overlaps other elements, or displays incorrectly.

## Description of the Error

The primary issue stems from CanvasJS's reliance on its initial rendering dimensions.  If these dimensions aren't dynamically updated to match the available space, the chart will not adapt to changes in the browser window size.  You might see the chart rendered incorrectly, with parts cut off, or completely failing to redraw itself.  The browser's developer console may or may not show specific errors, depending on the severity of the problem.  Often, it's simply a visual misalignment or an incomplete rendering.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example uses jQuery for simplicity, but the core concept applies regardless of your chosen JavaScript framework.  The key is to trigger a redraw of the CanvasJS chart whenever the window is resized.

**1. Include necessary libraries:**

```html
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> <!-- Or your preferred JS library -->
```

**2. Create your CanvasJS chart:**

```javascript
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    theme: "light2", // Or your preferred theme
    animationEnabled: true,
    title: {
        text: "Responsive Chart"
    },
    data: [{
        type: "column",
        dataPoints: [
            { x: 10, y: 71 },
            { x: 20, y: 55 },
            { x: 30, y: 50 },
            { x: 40, y: 65 },
            { x: 50, y: 92 }
        ]
    }]
});
chart.render();
```

**3. Add a resize handler:**

```javascript
$(window).resize(function() {
  chart.render(); //This line is crucial.  It forces a redraw.
});
```

**4. Ensure proper container sizing:**

Make sure the div with the id "chartContainer" is sized appropriately using CSS.  For responsive design, use percentages or viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) instead of fixed pixels.

```css
#chartContainer {
  width: 100%; /* Or a percentage */
  height: 400px; /* Or a percentage or vh */
}
```

**5. Complete HTML structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Responsive CanvasJS Chart</title>
  <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    #chartContainer {
      width: 100%;
      height: 400px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer"></div>
  <script>
    // JavaScript code from steps 2 and 3 goes here
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```


## Explanation

The core solution lies in the `$(window).resize()` function and the `chart.render()` call within it.  The resize event listener detects changes in the browser window's dimensions.  When a resize occurs, `chart.render()` forces CanvasJS to recalculate the chart's layout and redraw it using the new available space. Without this, the chart retains its original size and position, leading to the rendering issues.  Using percentage-based or viewport-relative sizing in your CSS ensures that the container adapts to the available screen space, allowing the chart to resize correctly.
