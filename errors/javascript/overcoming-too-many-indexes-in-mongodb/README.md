# üêû Overcoming "Too Many Indexes" in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is having "too many indexes".  While indexes are crucial for query performance, creating excessive indexes can negatively impact write performance and storage space.  MongoDB's write operations become slower as more indexes need updating whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. This leads to reduced application throughput and increased operational costs.  The error itself isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance bottleneck manifesting as slow write times and increased storage usage.  You might observe this through monitoring tools or simply noticing a significant slowdown in your application's write operations.

## Fixing "Too Many Indexes" Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes, a crucial step in resolving "Too Many Indexes" issues.  We will use the `mongo` shell for demonstration.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we list all indexes on a collection. Let's assume we're working with a collection named `products`:

```javascript
use myDatabase
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and other metadata.  Examine this list carefully.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

The next step is to analyze which indexes are actually used.  MongoDB provides tools to do this; the simplest is through server monitoring and profiling. Look for slow write operations and identify the collections involved. You can use MongoDB Profiler (enable it carefully, as it adds overhead) or your monitoring system to see which indexes are frequently used and which are rarely or never used.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified unused or underutilized indexes, you can remove them using the `dropIndex()` method.  For example, if you have an index on the `color` field that's proving unnecessary:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { color: 1 } )
```

Replace `{ color: 1 }` with the actual index specification from the output of `getIndexes()`.  The `1` indicates ascending order; `-1` would indicate descending.  You can drop multiple indexes at once:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndexes([ { color: 1 }, { size: -1 } ])
```


**Step 4: Test and Monitor**

After removing indexes, thoroughly test your application's write performance.  Use monitoring tools to observe write times and storage usage.  If the improvements are unsatisfactory, you might need to revisit your index strategy.

**Step 5: Optimize Index Strategy (Advanced)**

If you still face performance issues after removing unnecessary indexes, consider optimizing your remaining indexes.  This may involve:

* **Compound Indexes:** Use compound indexes to optimize queries involving multiple fields.
* **Index Selection:** Carefully choose the appropriate index type (e.g., hashed, unique, etc.) for your specific use case.
* **Index Coverage:** Ensure that your indexes cover the fields used in your queries' `$where` clauses if possible (avoiding `$where` usage as much as possible is a good idea).


## Explanation

The "Too Many Indexes" problem arises from the tradeoff between read and write performance.  While indexes speed up read operations by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents matching specific criteria, they come at a cost: every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all relevant indexes.  With too many indexes, the overhead of index maintenance overwhelms the benefits of faster reads.  The solution involves carefully selecting and maintaining only the indexes that significantly benefit your application's query performance.
