# üêû Resolving VideoJS Playback Issues on iOS Safari with Autoplay


This document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using Video.js on iOS Safari: the inability to autoplay videos.  While autoplay is generally restricted by browser policies for a better user experience, there are specific circumstances and techniques to make it work within these limitations.  This issue usually manifests as the video not starting automatically when the page loads.

**Description of the Error:**

When attempting to autoplay a video using Video.js on iOS Safari, the video simply remains paused.  The console might not show any explicit errors, making debugging challenging. This is because iOS Safari's autoplay policy is strict, requiring user interaction before a video can automatically play.


**Code (Step-by-Step Fix):**

This solution focuses on using a user interaction trigger to initiate playback.  We'll employ a combination of event listeners and a subtle visual cue to satisfy iOS's autoplay restrictions.

**1. HTML Structure (index.html):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video.js Autoplay Fix</title>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-big-play-centered" controls preload="auto" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup="{}">
    <source src="myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">
      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
      web browser that supports HTML5 video
    </p>
  </video>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js"></script>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**2. JavaScript (script.js):**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  var player = videojs('my-video');

  // Add a small, visually unobtrusive element to trigger playback
  var trigger = document.createElement('div');
  trigger.style.width = '1px';
  trigger.style.height = '1px';
  trigger.style.opacity = '0';
  document.body.appendChild(trigger);


  trigger.addEventListener('click', function() {
    player.play();
    this.remove(); // Remove the trigger after playback starts
  });

  //Simulate a click after a small delay to initiate autoplay
  setTimeout(() => {
    trigger.click();
  }, 100);


});

```

**3. Explanation:**

* We add a tiny, invisible `div` element to the page.
* This `div` acts as a user interaction trigger. iOS Safari will allow autoplay if it's triggered by an actual user interaction.
* A `setTimeout` function simulates a click on this element after a short delay (100 milliseconds) making it practically invisible to the user. This bypasses Safari's autoplay restrictions.
* Once the video starts playing, the trigger element is removed to clean up the DOM.  This is crucial for a better user experience.
