# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Issues within a CanvasJS Chart Container


## Description of the Error

A common problem developers encounter is the failure of a VideoJS player to initialize correctly when embedded within a CanvasJS chart container. This typically manifests as a blank space where the video player should be, or error messages in the browser's console related to player initialization or element finding. The root cause is often a conflict between the two libraries' DOM manipulation or timing of element rendering. CanvasJS might render its chart elements before VideoJS has a chance to fully initialize and attach its player to the designated HTML element.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example assumes you're using a basic HTML structure with a `<div>` element intended to hold the VideoJS player, embedded within a `<div>` designated for the CanvasJS chart.

**1. HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>VideoJS in CanvasJS</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.canvasjs.com/4.3.3/canvasjs.min.js"></script> <!-- Replace with your CanvasJS version -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.min.js"></script>  <!-- Replace with your VideoJS version -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  <div id="myVideo" style="width:640px;height:360px;"></div>
  <script src="script.js"></script> </body>
</html>
```

**2. JavaScript (script.js):**

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  // CanvasJS chart initialization (replace with your chart data)
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    animationEnabled: true,
    title: {
      text: "Chart Title"
    },
    data: [{
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [
        { y: 10, label: "Apple" },
        { y: 15, label: "Orange" },
        { y: 25, label: "Banana" }
      ]
    }]
  });
  chart.render();


  //Ensure CanvasJS is fully rendered before initializing VideoJS
  setTimeout(() => {
    // VideoJS player initialization
      videojs('myVideo', {
        sources: [{ src: "your_video.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }], //replace with your video source
        autoplay: false,
      }, function() {
        console.log("Video.js player is ready");
      });
  }, 500); // Adjust timeout as needed, depends on chart rendering time

};
```

**Explanation:**

The key change is the use of `setTimeout`. This function delays the initialization of the VideoJS player for 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds).  This gives CanvasJS sufficient time to render its chart and ensure the DOM element (`#myVideo`) exists and is ready for VideoJS to attach to. You may need to adjust the timeout value depending on the complexity of your chart and the speed of your user's machine.  Experiment to find a suitable delay.
