# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Issues within a CanvasJS Chart Container


This document addresses a common problem encountered when attempting to embed a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's container.  The issue often manifests as the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render correctly, leaving a blank space where the video should be. This usually happens because VideoJS requires a properly sized and rendered DOM element to function correctly, and CanvasJS might not provide this immediately or in the way VideoJS expects, especially if there are asynchronous rendering operations.

## Description of the Error

The error isn't a specific JavaScript error message, but rather a visual one: the VideoJS player either doesn't appear at all or shows a broken/empty placeholder within the designated CanvasJS chart container.  The browser's developer console may be silent, or may show unrelated warnings unrelated to the core issue. This is often due to a race condition where VideoJS attempts initialization before the CanvasJS chart has fully rendered the container element.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This solution uses a technique to ensure the CanvasJS chart is fully rendered before initializing the VideoJS player. We leverage the `afterSetOptions` event provided by CanvasJS.

```javascript
// Include necessary libraries (ensure correct paths)
// <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
// <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.19.2/video.min.js"></script>

window.onload = function () {

  // CanvasJS Chart setup
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    // ... your CanvasJS chart options ...
    animationEnabled: true,
    title: {
      text: "My Chart"
    },
    data: [
      // ... your data points ...
    ],
    afterSetOptions: function(){
      initializeVideoJS();
    }
  });
  chart.render();

  function initializeVideoJS() {
    // VideoJS Player setup
    var player = videojs('myVideo', {
      sources: [{
        src: 'your_video.mp4',
        type: 'video/mp4'
      }],
      autoplay: false,
      controls: true
    });
    //Optional: Handle potential errors gracefully
    player.on('error', function(error){
      console.error("VideoJS Error:", error);
      //Add any desired error handling logic.  For example, display an alternative message to the user.
    });
  }
};


```

**HTML Structure (Important):** Make sure you have a `<div>` with the ID `chartContainer` and another nested `<video>` element with the ID `myVideo` within the `chartContainer`.

```html
<div id="chartContainer">
    <video id="myVideo" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" width="640" height="360"></video>
</div>
```

## Explanation

The key to the solution is using the `afterSetOptions` callback within the CanvasJS chart configuration.  This callback function executes *after* CanvasJS has finished setting up its internal elements and rendered the chart to the DOM. This guarantees that the `chartContainer` div exists and is properly sized before the VideoJS player initialization (`initializeVideoJS` function) is called.  This avoids the race condition and ensures the player can access a valid container element.  The use of  `window.onload` ensures the DOM is fully loaded before trying to access and modify elements.
