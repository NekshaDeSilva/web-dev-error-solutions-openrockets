# üêû Fixing VideoJS Playback Issues on Mobile Devices


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using Video.js is poor playback performance or outright failure on mobile devices, especially older or lower-powered ones.  This often manifests as:

* **Video not playing at all:** The video player loads, but the video remains stubbornly blank.
* **Stuttering or buffering:** The video plays intermittently, with frequent pauses and buffering indicators.
* **Poor quality:** The video resolution is significantly lower than expected, even with a good internet connection.

This is frequently caused by a combination of factors: insufficient browser resources, incompatibility with specific codecs, or improper configuration of the Video.js player.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example focuses on improving performance by using adaptive streaming and specifying supported codecs.  We'll assume you're using a video source provided via a `video` tag and integrating Video.js using its CDN.

**1. Include Video.js and necessary plugins:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Video.js Example</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

<video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg">
  <source src="myvideo.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'>
  <source src="myvideo.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p>
</video>

<script>
  var player = videojs('my-video');
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**2. Utilize Adaptive Streaming (HLS or DASH):**

Adaptive streaming technologies like HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) dynamically adjust video quality based on network conditions. This significantly improves playback on mobile networks with fluctuating bandwidth.  Replace the single `source` elements with HLS or DASH manifests:


```html
<video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg">
  <source src="myvideo.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL">  <!-- Example HLS -->
  <source src="myvideo.mpd" type="application/dash+xml"> <!-- Example DASH -->
  <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p>
</video>
```

**3. Optimize Video Encoding:**

Ensure your videos are encoded with codecs widely supported on mobile devices, such as H.264 (AVC) for MP4 and VP9 or VP8 for WebM. Use lower bitrates for lower resolutions to cater to slower connections. Tools like HandBrake can assist with this.

**4.  Consider using a plugin for further improvements:**


Video.js has a vast plugin ecosystem. Plugins can help with things like:

* **Advertising:**  If you are showing ads, make sure the ads are mobile friendly.
* **Analytics:** Track the performance of your videos.


## Explanation

The original problem stems from the limitations of mobile devices and network conditions. By using adaptive streaming, you allow the player to seamlessly switch between different quality levels based on available bandwidth. Providing multiple codecs ensures compatibility with various devices.  Optimizing video encoding reduces the demands on mobile processors and improves playback smoothness.
