# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Controls Not Appearing After Initialization


## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when using Video.js is the failure of player controls to appear after the player has been initialized.  The player might load the video, but the play/pause button, volume slider, progress bar, and other controls remain invisible. This can be frustrating for users, as they lack the basic functionality to interact with the video. This problem often stems from incorrect initialization, CSS conflicts, or missing dependencies.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example demonstrates a common scenario and its solution.  Let's assume your HTML structure looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video.js Example</title>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup="{}">
    <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="my-video.webm" type="video/webm">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p>
  </video>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var player = videojs('my-video');
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Problem:**  Even with the `controls` attribute set, the controls might not appear. This is often due to CSS conflicts overriding the Video.js styling.  The player might be initialized correctly, but the controls are hidden by external styles.


**Solution:**

1. **Inspect Your CSS:** Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12) and inspect the `video-js` element. Check for any CSS rules that might be setting `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;`, or affecting the height/width of the control bar.  Remove or override these conflicting styles.

2. **Ensure Correct Video.js Inclusion:** Verify that you've correctly included both the Video.js CSS and JavaScript files.  The order matters ‚Äì CSS should come before the JavaScript.

3. **Check for JavaScript Errors:** The browser's console (usually part of the developer tools) may reveal JavaScript errors preventing the controls from rendering. Fix these errors.

4. **Explicitly Show Controls (if necessary):** As a last resort, you can try explicitly showing the controls using JavaScript:

```javascript
var player = videojs('my-video');
player.ready(function() {
  this.controlBar.show(); // This ensures the control bar is visible.
});
```


**Complete Corrected Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video.js Example</title>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    /* Add any necessary CSS overrides here to resolve conflicts */
    /*Example: Remove conflicting styles if any exist*/
    .video-js .vjs-control-bar {
        display: block !important; /*This line is added to override any styles hiding controls*/
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup="{}">
    <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="my-video.webm" type="video/webm">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p>
  </video>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    var player = videojs('my-video');
    player.ready(function() {
      this.controlBar.show();
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```


## Explanation

The `controls` attribute in the `<video>` tag is usually sufficient to display the controls. However, CSS conflicts or JavaScript errors can prevent them from appearing.  The solution involves debugging CSS rules, verifying JavaScript inclusion and execution, and, if necessary, using the `this.controlBar.show()` method in Video.js to explicitly make the controls visible. Remember to replace `"my-video.mp4"`, `"my-video.webm"`, and `"poster.jpg"` with your actual video and poster image file paths.
