# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Height Issues on CanvasJS Integration


## Description of the Error

A common issue when integrating VideoJS into a CanvasJS visualization is unexpected height discrepancies.  The VideoJS player may not render at the intended size, either overflowing its container or appearing too small. This often occurs when the player's dimensions are not properly managed within the CanvasJS chart's layout or when conflicting CSS styles are applied.  The problem manifests as a visually misaligned or incorrectly sized video player within the CanvasJS chart, hindering the user experience.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example assumes you are using VideoJS and CanvasJS within a webpage.  Let's address the height issue by ensuring the VideoJS player respects its container's dimensions and adapts to the available space within the CanvasJS chart.

**1. HTML Structure:**

Ensure your HTML structure nests the VideoJS player correctly within a container that is part of the CanvasJS chart's layout.  The container should have a defined height.  For this example, we'll use a `div` with the class `video-container`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>VideoJS in CanvasJS</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.canvasjs.com/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
<style>
.video-container {
    width: 600px;
    height: 300px; /* Crucial: Define the height of the container */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 500px; width: 600px;"></div>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```


**2. JavaScript (script.js):**


```javascript
window.onload = function () {
    //CanvasJS Chart setup.  Replace with your actual chart data
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        title:{
            text: "My Chart"
        },
        data: [{
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { x: 10, y: 71 },
                { x: 20, y: 55 },
                { x: 30, y: 50 },
                { x: 40, y: 65 }
            ]
        }]
    });
    chart.render();


    // VideoJS setup (after CanvasJS chart rendering)
    var videoContainer = document.createElement('div');
    videoContainer.className = 'video-container';
    chart.container.appendChild(videoContainer);

    var player = videojs(videoContainer, {
      sources: [{ src: 'your_video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],
      width: '100%', //Ensures player fills the container width
      height: '100%', // Ensures player fills the container height
      autoresize: true // Enables responsive resizing
    });

    player.ready(function() {
      this.on('loadedmetadata', function(){
        //Optionally adjust the aspect ratio if needed after metadata is loaded.
        // this.width(videoContainer.offsetWidth);  //Example
        // this.height(videoContainer.offsetHeight); //Example

      });
    });
    player.play();
};

```


**3. Explanation:**

* **Defined Container Height:** The crucial change is assigning a specific height to the `.video-container` div.  This gives VideoJS a clear size constraint to work within.
* **Relative Sizing:** We use `width: '100%';` and `height: '100%';` in the VideoJS options to ensure the player scales to fill its parent container.
* **`autoresize: true`:** This option in the VideoJS configuration ensures that if the container's size changes (e.g., due to window resizing), the VideoJS player will resize accordingly.
* **Append to Chart Container:** We append the video container (`videoContainer`) to the chart's container after the chart is rendered to ensure proper layout.
