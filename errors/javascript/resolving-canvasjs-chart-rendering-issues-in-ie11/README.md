# üêû Resolving CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in IE11


## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is the failure of the chart to render correctly or at all.  The chart might appear blank, show only parts of itself, or throw JavaScript errors related to canvas rendering or unsupported features.  This is primarily due to IE11's limited support for modern JavaScript features and canvas rendering optimizations used by CanvasJS.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example focuses on ensuring compatibility by including a fallback mechanism and addressing potential IE11-specific issues.  We will create a simple chart and add fallback logic.

**1. Include CanvasJS:**

First, ensure you have included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file.  You can download it from the official website.

```html
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script> 
```

**2.  Basic Chart Code:**

This is a basic example of a CanvasJS column chart.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<title>CanvasJS IE11 Fix</title>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
<script>
window.onload = function () {
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        animationEnabled: true,
        title:{
            text: "Simple Column Chart"
        },
        data: [{
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { label: "Apple", y: 10 },
                { label: "Orange", y: 15 },
                { label: "Banana", y: 25 }
            ]
        }]
    });
    chart.render();
}
</script>
</BODY>
</HTML>
```

**3. Adding IE11 Compatibility Check and Fallback:**

This improved version adds a check for IE11 and displays a message if the chart cannot render.  Note that a more sophisticated fallback, perhaps using a different charting library or a simpler visualization, would be preferable in a production environment.


```javascript
window.onload = function () {
    var isIE11 = !!window.MSInputMethodContext && !!document.documentMode;

    if (isIE11) {
        // Check for IE11
        var chartContainer = document.getElementById("chartContainer");
        chartContainer.innerHTML = "<p>CanvasJS chart not fully supported in this browser. Please use a modern browser.</p>";
    } else {
        //Regular CanvasJS Chart Code
        var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
            animationEnabled: true,
            title:{
                text: "Simple Column Chart"
            },
            data: [{
                type: "column",
                dataPoints: [
                    { label: "Apple", y: 10 },
                    { label: "Orange", y: 15 },
                    { label: "Banana", y: 25 }
                ]
            }]
        });
        chart.render();
    }
}
```


## Explanation

The solution involves detecting if the browser is IE11 using a feature detection technique. If it is, a simple message is displayed instead of attempting to render the chart, preventing errors.  For a more robust solution, you might consider:

* **Using a polyfill:**  Polyfills can provide some missing functionality in IE11, although they might not always solve all rendering issues.
* **Using a different charting library:** Libraries specifically designed for better cross-browser compatibility might be a better alternative for projects needing wide browser support.
* **Conditional loading:**  Load different chart libraries based on browser detection.
