# üêû Creating a CSS-Only Expanding Card with a Reveal Effect


This document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. The card reveals additional content upon hover, offering a smooth and engaging user experience. We'll achieve this effect using CSS transitions and transforms.  No JavaScript is required.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card features a simple design.  On hover, the card expands horizontally, revealing hidden content.  This expansion is coupled with a subtle opacity change to further enhance the visual effect. The styling is clean and modern, easily adaptable to various themes.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content outside the card */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scaleX(1.1); /* Expand horizontally on hover */
  opacity: 0.9; /* Slightly reduce opacity on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card-content-hidden {
  opacity: 0;
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the extra content initially */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */
}

.card:hover .card-content-hidden {
  opacity: 1;
  height: auto; /* Reveal hidden content on hover */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>This is the Title</h2>
    <p>This is the main content of the card.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-content card-content-hidden">
    <p>This is the additional content revealed on hover.</p>
    <p>More details here...</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the animation.  It specifies that the `transform` and `opacity` properties will smoothly transition over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.
* **`transform: scaleX(1.1)`:** This scales the card horizontally by 110% on hover, creating the expansion effect.
* **`opacity`:**  The subtle opacity change adds depth and visual feedback.
* **`.card-content-hidden`:** This class initially hides the extra content using `opacity: 0` and `height: 0`. The `overflow: hidden` prevents the hidden content from affecting the layout. On hover, its `opacity` and `height` are transitioned to reveal the content.
