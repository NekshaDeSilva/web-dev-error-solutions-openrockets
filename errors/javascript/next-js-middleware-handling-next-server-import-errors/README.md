# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `next/server` Import Errors


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: importing modules from `next/server`.  This error typically occurs when attempting to use `next/server` APIs within a file that is also accessible in the client-side environment.

**Description of the Error:**

You might encounter a build-time or runtime error similar to:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'next/server' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

This indicates that you're trying to use server-side-only modules (like those from `next/server`) in a context where Next.js attempts to bundle them for the client.  This is usually because the file is imported or rendered in a client-side context, even if intended for middleware.

**Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's say you have a middleware file (`middleware.js`) trying to use `NextResponse` from `next/server`:

**Incorrect Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js (INCORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  url.pathname = '/new-page';
  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
}
```

This code *appears* correct, but the issue might arise if this `middleware.js` file is accidentally imported somewhere else in the application, for instance, in a client component.

**Correct Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js (CORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  url.pathname = '/new-page';
  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/page1', '/page2'], // Define which paths this middleware should apply to.
};
```

**Explanation:**

The key here is the `config` export. This explicitly tells Next.js that this file is middleware and limits its scope to server-side execution only.  The `matcher` property defines the routes the middleware will affect. Without this `config` export, Next.js might try to bundle the file for client-side execution, leading to the import error.

* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction): While not directly related to this specific error, understanding API routes helps contrast with middleware functionality.


**Further Considerations:**

* **Accidental Imports:** Carefully review all your imports to ensure that `middleware.js` (or similar middleware files) are *not* imported into any client components or pages.
* **File Naming:** While not a direct cause, using descriptive filenames (like `middleware.js` or `my-middleware.js`) can improve readability and reduce accidental misuses.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your middleware to ensure it functions as intended and doesn't inadvertently cause client-side errors.
