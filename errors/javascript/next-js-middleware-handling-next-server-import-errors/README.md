# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `next/server` Import Errors


This document addresses a common error developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: the inability to import modules from `next/server` within pages or components designed for client-side rendering.

**Description of the Error:**

Attempting to import functions or components from `next/server` (like `NextResponse` or `redirect`) within a client-side component or page results in a runtime error.  This is because `next/server` is specifically designed for server-side code execution within Middleware and API routes.  The modules within `next/server` are not available in the browser's JavaScript environment.  The error message might vary, but it essentially communicates that a module or function is not defined.  For example: `ReferenceError: NextResponse is not defined` or similar.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you tried to use `NextResponse` in a page component to perform a redirect based on some client-side condition. This would be incorrect.

**Incorrect Code:**

```javascript
// pages/my-page.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

function MyPage() {
  const shouldRedirect = true; // Determined by client-side logic

  if (shouldRedirect) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-page', location.href));
  }

  return <div>My Page</div>;
}

export default MyPage;
```

This code will throw an error because `NextResponse` is attempted to be used on the client-side.

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

The correct approach involves leveraging Middleware for server-side redirects or using client-side routing mechanisms for client-side decisions. Here's how to resolve this using Middleware:

1. **Create a Middleware file:** Create a file within the `middleware` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).  For example, `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`.


2. **Import `NextResponse` correctly:** Import `NextResponse` within your Middleware file.

3. **Implement Redirection Logic:**  Use `NextResponse.redirect` within your middleware function to perform the redirection based on server-side conditions (or conditions you can determine on the server).  Do NOT attempt to rely on client-side data here.

**Corrected Code (Middleware):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();

  // Example condition based on a query parameter
  if (req.nextUrl.searchParams.get('redirect') === 'true') {
      url.pathname = '/new-page';
      return NextResponse.rewrite(url); //or NextResponse.redirect(url)
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/my-page'], // Apply middleware only to /my-page
};
```

4. **Update your page:** Your `pages/my-page.js` now no longer needs the `NextResponse` import. It can focus purely on client-side rendering.

```javascript
// pages/my-page.js
function MyPage() {
  return <div>My Page</div>;
}

export default MyPage;
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code uses Next.js Middleware to handle the redirection. Middleware runs on the server before the page is rendered.  This allows the use of `next/server` modules without encountering the "not defined" error. The `matcher` property in the `config` object specifies the paths to which the middleware applies.
