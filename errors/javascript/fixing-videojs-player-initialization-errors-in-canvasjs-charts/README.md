# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Initialization Errors in CanvasJS Charts


## Description of the Error

A common issue arises when attempting to integrate a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's visualization.  This often manifests as the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render correctly, resulting in a blank space where the video should be, or error messages in the browser's developer console.  This problem frequently stems from conflicts between the initialization order of the JavaScript libraries, improper DOM element selection, or resource loading issues. The symptoms can vary, from a completely absent video player to the player appearing but not displaying the video content.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example assumes you're using a `<div>` to hold the VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's container.  Adjust selectors as needed to match your HTML structure.

**1. Ensure Correct Library Inclusion:**

First, verify that both CanvasJS and VideoJS libraries are correctly included in your HTML file.  Place the `<script>` tags before the closing `</body>` tag. It's generally recommended to put VideoJS *after* CanvasJS to avoid potential conflicts if VideoJS tries to access the DOM before CanvasJS has fully rendered the chart.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>CanvasJS and VideoJS Integration</title>
  <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script> <!--Replace with your CanvasJS path -->
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script> <!--Replace with your VideoJS path -->
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  <script>
    // CanvasJS chart code (see step 2)
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**2.  Chart Creation and Video Player Integration:**

Create your CanvasJS chart, making sure to leave space for the VideoJS player. Then, *after* the chart is rendered, initialize the VideoJS player.  This is crucial to avoid DOM conflicts. We use `window.onload` or a `setTimeout` to ensure the chart is fully rendered:

```javascript
window.onload = function() {
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    // Your CanvasJS chart configuration here...
    data: [
      {
        type: "column",
        dataPoints: [
          { x: 10, y: 71 },
          { x: 20, y: 55 },
          // ... more data points
        ]
      }
    ]
  });
  chart.render();

  setTimeout(function() { // wait for CanvasJS to render fully

    var videoContainer = document.createElement('div');
    videoContainer.id = 'myVideo';
    document.getElementById('chartContainer').appendChild(videoContainer);

    var player = videojs('myVideo', {
      sources: [{ src: 'your_video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }], // Replace with your video source
      autoplay: false,
      controls: true
    });
  }, 500); // Adjust timeout as needed, depending on chart rendering time.
};
```


## Explanation

The core problem lies in the timing of DOM manipulation. CanvasJS needs to fully render its chart before VideoJS attempts to access and modify the same DOM elements.  If VideoJS tries to initialize before the chart's container is ready, it might fail to find the correct element or encounter inconsistencies.  Using `setTimeout` or `window.onload` allows us to delay the VideoJS initialization until after the CanvasJS chart has completely rendered, resolving the conflict.  The `setTimeout` function provides a delay (in milliseconds);  adjust the delay (500ms in this example) if your chart takes longer to render.
