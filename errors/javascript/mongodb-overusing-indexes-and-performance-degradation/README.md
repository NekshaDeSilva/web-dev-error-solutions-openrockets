# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes and Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is overusing indexes. While indexes significantly speed up query performance by creating sorted structures for specific fields, adding too many or poorly chosen indexes can lead to significant performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation needs to update all affected indexes, adding overhead that can outweigh the benefits of faster reads.  This often manifests as slow application performance, especially noticeable during high-write load scenarios.  The symptoms might include:

* Significantly slower write operations (inserts, updates, deletes)
* High write latency
* Increased resource consumption (CPU, memory, I/O) on the MongoDB server


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates the problem and its solution using the `products` collection.  We'll assume the collection has fields like `name`, `price`, `category`, `description`, and `SKU`.

**Scenario:**  We've added indexes for `name`, `price`, `category`, and `SKU`, resulting in slow write performance.  We'll optimize by removing unnecessary indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

```javascript
use mydatabase; // Replace mydatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array of index definitions. Analyze the query patterns of your application. If an index isn't frequently used in queries, it's a candidate for removal.  In our scenario, let's assume the `description` field is rarely used in queries.


**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove the index on the `description` field (if it exists):


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("description_1"); // Replace "description_1" with the actual index name if different.  _1 indicates an ascending index.
```

You can replace `"description_1"` with the actual index name from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`. If you have compound indexes (indexes on multiple fields), you'll need the exact name of the compound index.


**Step 3: Verify Index Removal:**

Check again with `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm the index has been removed.


**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing unnecessary indexes, monitor your application's performance, especially write operations.  Use MongoDB monitoring tools or your application's logging to track write times, latency, and resource utilization.  You might use MongoDB Compass or the `mongostat` command-line utility.


## Explanation

Over-indexing slows down write operations because MongoDB must update all indexes whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted. This overhead becomes significant with many indexes. By analyzing query patterns and removing infrequently used indexes, you reduce the write overhead and improve overall database performance.  The optimal number of indexes depends on your application's workload; it's a balance between faster read operations and manageable write performance.
