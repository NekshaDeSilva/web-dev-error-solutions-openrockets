# 🐞 Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failure on CanvasJS Integration


## Description of the Error

A common issue when integrating VideoJS with CanvasJS (particularly when attempting to embed a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart element or dynamically adding it based on chart events) is a failure to initialize the VideoJS player. This manifests as an empty container where the player should be, or JavaScript errors relating to `videojs` being undefined or encountering issues with the player element's DOM structure.  The root cause often lies in timing issues: VideoJS attempts to initialize before the targeted DOM element is fully rendered or available, leading to initialization failures.

## Fixing Step-by-Step with Code

This solution focuses on ensuring VideoJS initialization occurs *after* the CanvasJS chart and its relevant DOM elements are fully rendered. We'll use a combination of CanvasJS's `dataLoaded` event and a small delay to ensure proper timing.


```javascript
// Assuming you have CanvasJS and VideoJS included in your project.

// CanvasJS Chart Configuration
var options = {
  theme: "light2", //Or any other theme
  animationEnabled: true,
  title: {
    text: "My Chart with Embedded Video"
  },
  data: [
    // Your chart data here
  ]
};

// Create the CanvasJS chart.
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", options);

// Listen for the CanvasJS dataLoaded event.  This signifies the chart is fully rendered.
chart.render();
chart.on("dataLoaded", function() {
    setTimeout(() => { // Add a small delay to be extra cautious
        // Initialize VideoJS player after chart is rendered.
        var player = videojs('myVideoPlayer', {
          //VideoJS options here. example:
          sources: [{ src: 'your_video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],
          poster: 'your_poster.jpg' // Poster image
        });

        //Optional: Error Handling. Check if videojs player is initialized successfully
        if (!player.isReady_) {
            console.error("VideoJS player failed to initialize. Check your configuration and ensure the 'myVideoPlayer' element exists.");
        } else {
            console.log("VideoJS player initialized successfully!");
        }


        player.on('ended', function() {
            console.log("Video ended");
            // Optional: Actions after video ends
        });
        player.on('error', function(error) {
            console.error("VideoJS player encountered an error:", error);
        });

    }, 200); //Adjust delay if needed, 200 milliseconds is usually sufficient.
});

```

Remember to replace  `'your_video.mp4'`, `'your_poster.jpg'`, and `"chartContainer"` and `"myVideoPlayer"` with your actual video file path, poster image path, and the IDs of your CanvasJS chart div and VideoJS player div, respectively. Ensure that the `<div id="myVideoPlayer"></div>` element is placed within or near the `"chartContainer"` div in your HTML.


## Explanation

The key improvement is using the `dataLoaded` event of CanvasJS. This ensures that the chart (and its containing DOM elements) are completely rendered before VideoJS attempts to initialize. The `setTimeout` function adds a small delay to account for potential minor rendering inconsistencies across different browsers.  This approach avoids the race condition where VideoJS tries to initialize before the element it needs exists in the DOM. The error handling provides valuable feedback during development and deployment.
