# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Height Issues in Responsive Designs


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when integrating Video.js into a responsive web design is the player's height not adjusting correctly to its container's dimensions.  This often results in the video player appearing stretched, squashed, or with significant letterboxing/pillarboxing, disrupting the user experience. The issue arises because the player's dimensions aren't dynamically updated to match the changes in the container's size as the browser window resizes or the page layout adjusts.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates fixing the height issue using a combination of CSS and JavaScript.  We'll assume your Video.js player is initialized within a container with the ID "my-video-player".

**Step 1:  Ensure Proper Container Sizing**

Your container element (`#my-video-player`) needs to have its dimensions set correctly, ideally using percentages or flexible units like `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) to allow it to resize responsively.  Avoid fixed pixel values for height and width unless you want a non-responsive player.


```html
<div id="my-video-player" style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative;">  <!-- Aspect ratio 16:9 -->
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-16-9" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg">
    <source src="myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">
      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
      <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a>
    </p>
  </video>
</div>

<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var player = videojs('my-video');
</script>
```

**Explanation of Step 1:**

* `width: 100%;`:  The container takes up the full width of its parent.
* `height: 0;`:  We set the height to zero initially.  This is crucial for the aspect ratio calculation.
* `padding-bottom: 56.25%;`: This is the key to maintaining aspect ratio.  `56.25%` (100%/16*9) ensures a 16:9 aspect ratio regardless of the container's width.  Adjust this percentage for different aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 would be `75%`).
* `position: relative;`:  This is needed for proper positioning of the video element within the container.

**Step 2: (Optional but Recommended) Using a CSS Class for Aspect Ratio**

For better maintainability, define the aspect ratio in a CSS class:

```css
.video-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
  position: relative;
}

.video-js {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

And then apply the class to your div:

```html
<div id="my-video-player" class="video-container">
  <!-- ... Video.js player code ... -->
</div>
```


**Step 3:  (Optional) JavaScript for Dynamic Resize (for complex scenarios)**

While the CSS approach usually suffices, for very complex layouts or situations where you need more precise control, you might add JavaScript to handle resizing events:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  player.width(player.el().parentElement.offsetWidth); // Update width based on container width
  player.height(player.el().parentElement.offsetWidth * 9 / 16); // Maintain aspect ratio
});
```

## Explanation

The core solution uses the `padding-bottom` trick. By setting the height to `0` and using a percentage-based padding-bottom, we create a container that automatically maintains the desired aspect ratio. The video player, positioned absolutely within this container, then expands to fill the available space while preserving the aspect ratio.  The optional JavaScript resize listener provides additional control in dynamic environments but is often unnecessary with the CSS-only solution.
