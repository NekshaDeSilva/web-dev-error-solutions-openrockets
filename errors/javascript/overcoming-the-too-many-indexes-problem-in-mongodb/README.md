# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


**Description of the Error:**

The "too many indexes" problem in MongoDB isn't a specific error message, but rather a performance bottleneck caused by excessive indexing.  While indexes speed up queries, an overabundance leads to:

* **Increased write times:**  Every write operation must update all relevant indexes, slowing down insertions, updates, and deletions.
* **Increased storage space:** Indexes consume disk space, impacting overall database size and potentially storage costs.
* **Query planner confusion:** The query planner may struggle to efficiently choose the best index for a given query amongst a vast number of options, leading to slower query execution.

This issue often arises from creating indexes without careful consideration of query patterns and data usage.  Developers might index fields used infrequently or create redundant indexes that cover the same query patterns.

**Code Example and Fixing Steps (Illustrative):**

Let's consider a scenario with a collection `products` having fields `category`, `name`, and `price`.  We've created indexes on each field individually and a compound index on `category` and `price`.  Performance is suffering.

**Step 1: Identify Unused or Redundant Indexes:**

First, we need to list the existing indexes using the `db.products.getIndexes()` command in the MongoDB shell.

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a list like this (simplified):

```json
[
  { "v" : 2, "key" : { "_id" : 1 }, "name" : "_id_" },
  { "v" : 2, "key" : { "category" : 1 }, "name" : "category_1" },
  { "v" : 2, "key" : { "name" : 1 }, "name" : "name_1" },
  { "v" : 2, "key" : { "price" : 1 }, "name : "price_1"},
  { "v" : 2, "key" : { "category" : 1, "price" : 1 }, "name" : "category_price_1" }
]
```

Let's assume that queries filtering by `name` are infrequent.  The `name_1` index is redundant because the compound index (`category_price_1`) already covers queries on `category` and `price`.


**Step 2: Drop Redundant Indexes:**

To drop an index, use the `db.products.dropIndex()` command.  We'll drop the `name_1` index:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("name_1")
```

**Step 3: Analyze Query Patterns:**

Review your application's queries to identify the most frequent query patterns.  For example, if you frequently query by `category` and `price`, the compound index `category_price_1` is beneficial.  However, if queries often filter by `category` and then sort by `price`, you might create a different compound index, for instance: `{"category":1, "price":-1}`

**Step 4 (Optional): Create Optimized Indexes (if needed):**

Based on the analysis, if you find additional indexes are necessary, create them strategically. For example,  to optimize queries that filter by category and then sort by price in ascending order:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

**Explanation:**

The key to avoiding "too many indexes" is careful planning and monitoring.  Use the MongoDB profiler to track query performance and identify which indexes are frequently used and which are not.  Create indexes only for frequently accessed fields or combinations of fields.  Regularly review and remove unused or redundant indexes to optimize write performance and storage usage.
