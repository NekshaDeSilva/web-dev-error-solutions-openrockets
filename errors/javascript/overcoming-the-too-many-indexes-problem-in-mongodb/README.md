# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common issue in MongoDB development arises from having too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation, particularly during write operations.  Every index adds overhead to insertion, update, and delete operations because MongoDB needs to maintain the consistency of all indexes.  This overhead can result in slower write times, increased resource consumption (CPU and disk I/O), and ultimately, a less responsive application.  MongoDB might even return errors indicating that resource limits are exceeded during index creation or updates. This is especially noticeable in high-volume applications.


## Fixing the Problem: Step-by-Step Code Example

This example demonstrates identifying and addressing excessive indexes using the MongoDB shell.  We'll focus on identifying unused indexes and selectively dropping them.  Assume we have a collection called `products` with many indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Unused Indexes**

First, we need to list all indexes and understand their usage. We'll use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method and then analyze the `usage` statistics (which require running profiling).

```javascript
// Enable profiling level 2 (log all operations) - crucial for usage analysis
db.setProfilingLevel(2)

// Wait for some activity on your collection (e.g., perform some queries)

// Get index information with usage statistics
var indexes = db.products.getIndexes();
printjson(indexes);

//Disable profiling
db.setProfilingLevel(0);

// Analyze the output ‚Äì look for indexes with very low or zero usage in the "usage" field.
// The output might not directly contain "usage", you may need to examine the profiler collection 
// (db.system.profile) to identify query patterns and determine index effectiveness.
```

**Step 2: Drop Unused Indexes**

Once you've identified indexes with negligible usage, you can safely drop them.  Remember to always carefully review before dropping any index.  The following example drops an index named `indexName`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("indexName");
```


**Step 3:  Monitor Performance After Changes**

After dropping indexes, carefully monitor the performance of your application. Use MongoDB's profiling tools or application performance monitoring to track write times and resource usage to ensure the changes have improved performance.


## Explanation

The problem of too many indexes is a classic case of optimization over-reach.  While indexes improve query performance, they come at a cost during write operations.  The key is finding a balance between read and write performance.  This involves:

* **Careful Index Selection:** Only create indexes that are truly necessary, focusing on frequently used queries. Use the `explain()` method to analyze query plans and identify opportunities for index optimization.
* **Regular Index Review:** Periodically review your indexes to identify and remove unused or less effective ones.  Analyze your query patterns and adapt your indexes as needed.
* **Compound Indexes:**  Consider compound indexes to improve performance for queries involving multiple fields. A well-designed compound index can often replace multiple single-field indexes.
* **Using the Right Index Type:**  Choose the appropriate index type (e.g., `hashed`, `text`, `geoSpatial`) for your data and queries.
