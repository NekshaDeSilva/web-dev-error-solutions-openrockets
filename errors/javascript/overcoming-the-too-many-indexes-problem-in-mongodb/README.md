# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is having too many indexes. While indexes speed up query performance, an excessive number can significantly impact write performance, storage space, and overall database efficiency.  This occurs because every write operation needs to update all applicable indexes, and too many indexes increase this overhead considerably.  The symptoms include slow write operations, increased storage usage, and potentially query performance degradation despite having many indexes.  MongoDB itself may not directly throw an error, but the performance degradation will be noticeable.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address excessive indexes using MongoDB Compass and the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method. We'll focus on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a hypothetical "products" collection.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes using MongoDB Compass**

1. Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
2. Select the database and then the "products" collection.
3. Navigate to the "Indexes" tab.  This tab will list all indexes currently defined on the collection.  Review each index carefully to determine its necessity.  Look for indexes that are rarely used or are redundant (e.g., covering the same fields with slight variations in options).

**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes using the MongoDB Shell**

1. Connect to your MongoDB instance using the mongo shell.
2. Execute the following command to retrieve a list of all indexes for the "products" collection:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of index documents.  Analyze these documents to identify candidates for removal.  Pay close attention to the `key` field, which defines the indexed fields.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes (Example)**

Let's say we've identified an index on the `description` field that's rarely used and causing performance problems.  To remove it, use the following command in the MongoDB shell, replacing `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index (taken from the output of `db.products.getIndexes()`):

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("<index_name>")
```

For instance, if the index name is "description_1", the command would be:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("description_1")
```

**Step 4: Verify Index Removal**

After removing an index, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to verify its removal.


**Step 5: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, closely monitor write performance, storage usage and query performance for improvement.  You might need to iterate through this process several times, carefully evaluating the impact of each index removal.


## Explanation

Having too many indexes causes performance problems primarily because of increased write overhead. Every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes.  Redundant or infrequently used indexes contribute significantly to this overhead, slowing down write operations.  This can cascade to negatively impacting read operations, even though indexes are supposed to improve them.  Careful selection and pruning of indexes are crucial to achieve optimal database performance.  The choice of indexes should always be based on the most frequently used queries.
