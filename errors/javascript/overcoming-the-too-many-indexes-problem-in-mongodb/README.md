# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Indexes" Problem in MongoDB


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB stemming from an excessive number of indexes.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, having too many can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead.  This is particularly noticeable in high-write environments.

**Description of the Error:**

The primary symptom of having too many indexes is slow write operations.  `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations become noticeably slower as the number of indexes increases because each write operation must update every applicable index.  You might observe increased latency and reduced throughput in your application.  Monitoring tools will reveal slow write times and potentially high storage usage related to index files.  In severe cases, you might encounter write bottlenecks completely crippling your application.

**Code & Fixing Steps (Illustrative Example):**

This example demonstrates identifying and removing unnecessary indexes using the MongoDB shell.  Replace `<your_database>` and `<your_collection>` with your actual database and collection names.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
use <your_database>;
db.<your_collection>.getIndexes();
```

This command lists all indexes on the specified collection.  Pay close attention to the index keys and usage statistics (if available through monitoring tools).  Indexes with very low usage are prime candidates for removal.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Let's assume we find an index `{"field1": 1, "field2": -1}` with negligible usage.  We remove it using:

```javascript
db.<your_collection>.dropIndex({"field1": 1, "field2": -1});
```

**Step 3: Verify Removal:**

Re-run `db.<your_collection>.getIndexes()` to confirm the index has been successfully removed.

**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, closely monitor write performance metrics to assess the impact. Use your application monitoring tools or the MongoDB monitoring tools to track improvements.


**Explanation:**

Indexes in MongoDB are B-tree structures that accelerate queries by creating sorted access paths to data.  However, every write operation necessitates updating all relevant indexes.  Too many indexes lead to excessive write overhead, resulting in slower write performance and increased resource consumption.  The key is to strike a balance:  having enough indexes to optimize frequently used queries while avoiding an excessive number that hampers write operations.  Careful analysis of query patterns and index usage statistics is crucial to identifying and eliminating redundant or underutilized indexes.
