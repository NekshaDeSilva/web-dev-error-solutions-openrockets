# üêû Resolving VideoJS Playback Issues on Mobile Devices with Autoplay


## Description of the Error

A common frustration with VideoJS on mobile devices is the inability to autoplay videos. While autoplay is generally supported, modern browsers prioritize user experience and often restrict autoplay unless certain conditions are met (e.g., muted video, user interaction).  This leads to videos failing to start automatically, leaving users with a blank screen or a silent, unmoving video player.  This problem often manifests without explicit error messages in the console, making debugging challenging.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This solution focuses on implementing a strategy that works around browser restrictions by using a muted autoplay attempt and then giving users control to unmute:

**Step 1: Setting up the Video.js Player (HTML):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Video.js Autoplay Fix</title>
<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-big-play-centered" controls preload="auto" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup='{"sources":[{"src":"video.mp4","type":"video/mp4"}]}'>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p>
  </video>
  <script>
    //JavaScript code will go here.
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 2: Enabling Muted Autoplay and User Interaction (JavaScript):**

```javascript
var player = videojs('my-video');

// Attempt muted autoplay
player.ready(function(){
  this.muted(true);
  this.play();
});


//Detect user interaction to remove muted attribute
let userInteracted = false;

document.addEventListener("click", function() {
  userInteracted = true;
});

player.on('play', function() {
  if (userInteracted) {
    this.muted(false);
  }
});

```

**Step 3:  Testing and Refinement:**

Test the implementation on various mobile devices and browsers. Observe whether the video auto-plays muted initially, and then unmutes upon any user interaction (tap/click). Adjust the strategy if the autoplay is still blocked; some browsers might require more sophisticated techniques.


## Explanation

The solution leverages the fact that muted autoplay is often permitted even with strict autoplay policies.  The JavaScript code attempts to play the video immediately after the player is ready, ensuring that it is muted.  The `userInteracted` flag combined with the `play` event listener then unmutes the video only after a user interacts with the page. This respects user preferences while still providing a convenient autoplay experience.
