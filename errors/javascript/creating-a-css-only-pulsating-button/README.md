# üêû Creating a CSS-only Pulsating Button


This document details how to create a pulsating button effect using only CSS.  This technique utilizes CSS animations and keyframes to achieve a visually appealing and subtle animation without the need for JavaScript.  This is a great example of how CSS can be used to add dynamic visual effects to a website.

**Description of the Styling:**

The styling creates a button that subtly expands and contracts in size, giving the appearance of a gentle pulse. This is achieved using a CSS animation that cycles through different scaling transformations. The animation is smooth and non-distracting, enhancing the user experience without being overly flashy.  We'll customize the button's appearance using basic CSS properties as well.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Pulsating Button</title>
<style>
.pulsating-button {
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */
  border: none;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 32px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 16px;
  margin: 4px 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 5px;
  animation: pulsate 1s ease-in-out infinite; /* Add the animation */
}

@keyframes pulsate {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.05);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Click the Pulsating Button!</h1>

<button class="pulsating-button">Click Me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **HTML Structure:**  A simple HTML button element with the class `pulsating-button` is created.

2. **CSS Styling:** The `pulsating-button` class styles the button with a green background, white text, padding, and other basic button properties.

3. **CSS Animation:** The `animation` property applies the `pulsate` animation to the button.  This animation has a duration of 1 second (`1s`), uses an `ease-in-out` timing function for a smooth transition, and is set to run infinitely (`infinite`).

4. **`@keyframes pulsate`:** This section defines the animation itself.  It uses the `transform: scale()` property to change the size of the button.  At 0% and 100% of the animation, the scale is 1 (normal size).  At 50%, the scale is 1.05 (slightly larger), creating the pulsating effect.
