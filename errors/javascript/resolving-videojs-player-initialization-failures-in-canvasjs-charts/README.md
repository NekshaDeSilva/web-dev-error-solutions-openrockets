# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failures in CanvasJS Charts


## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when integrating VideoJS with CanvasJS charts involves the VideoJS player failing to initialize correctly, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be, or throwing JavaScript errors related to undefined objects or methods. This typically occurs when the VideoJS initialization code is executed before the DOM element it targets is fully loaded, or when there's a conflict between VideoJS and other JavaScript libraries, particularly those affecting DOM manipulation.

This problem is exacerbated if you're attempting to dynamically generate the VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's update or render cycle, where timing is critical.  The chart's rendering process might outpace the player's initialization.

## Fixing Step by Step

This example demonstrates a fix assuming your VideoJS player is integrated within a chart's dataPoint.

**Step 1: Ensure DOM Element Existence**

The most common cause is attempting to initialize VideoJS before the `<video>` element exists in the DOM.  Use a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to guarantee the DOM is fully ready.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  // Your VideoJS and CanvasJS initialization code here
});
```

**Step 2:  Deferred Initialization within CanvasJS**

If you're dynamically creating the VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's update function, use the `afterSetOptions` callback to ensure that the chart is fully rendered before initializing the player.

```javascript
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
  // ... your chart options ...
  afterSetOptions: function () {
    // Find the video element (assuming it's linked to a dataPoint)
    let videoElement = document.getElementById("myVideoElement"); 

    if (videoElement) {
      // Initialize VideoJS only if the element exists
      videojs(videoElement).ready(function(){
        var myPlayer = this;
        // Access player properties
        console.log(myPlayer.currentTime());
      });
    } else {
      console.error("Video element not found!");
    }

  },
  data: [
    {
      // ... your data points ...
       // Example assuming you embed video info in dataPoint
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [{ y: 10, videoId: "myVideoElement"}]
    }
  ]
});
chart.render();


//Assuming video is added in the DOM like this:
//Add the Video element into your DOM. Replace 'your-video-url' with your actual URL.

const videoContainer = document.getElementById("myVideoElement");

if(!videoContainer){
    console.error("Video container not found!");
    return;
}

videoContainer.innerHTML = `<video id="myVideo" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="264" poster="my-poster.jpg" data-setup="{}">
  <source src="your-video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="your-video-url.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p class="vjs-no-js">
    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
    <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a>
  </p>
</video>`;


```

**Step 3: Version Compatibility**

Ensure compatibility between your versions of VideoJS and other libraries. Check for known conflicts on the VideoJS issue tracker.


## Explanation

The core principle here is to prioritize DOM readiness.  Attempting to manipulate the DOM (by initializing VideoJS) before the relevant elements are fully loaded leads to errors.  The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures the script runs only after the page's core HTML is parsed.  Using `afterSetOptions` in CanvasJS ensures that the chart has finished its rendering before attempting VideoJS initialization, preventing conflicts that might result from concurrent DOM manipulation.  The conditional check (`if (videoElement)`) adds an extra layer of robustness by only initializing VideoJS if the target element actually exists.
