# üêû MongoDB: Overusing Indexes Leading to Performance Degradation


## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is over-indexing. While indexes significantly speed up queries by creating sorted structures of specific fields, creating too many indexes, or indexes on the wrong fields, can severely impact write performance and database size.  Every index consumes disk space, and writing data requires updating all relevant indexes. Excessive indexing can lead to slower insertion, update, and delete operations, offsetting any query performance gains.  The system can become I/O-bound, resulting in noticeable performance degradation across all operations.

## Scenario: Over-indexed e-commerce Product Catalog

Let's consider an e-commerce application with a "products" collection.  We've indexed almost every field: `name`, `description`, `price`, `category`, `brand`, `tags`, `stock`, etc., individually and in various combinations.  Insertion of new products is slow, and even simple queries might not benefit significantly from this extensive indexing.


## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Example and Explanation)

The solution lies in a strategic approach to indexing. We need to identify the most frequently used queries and create indexes tailored to optimize *those* specific queries. Let's assume our most frequent queries are:

1. Finding products by category: `db.products.find({ category: "electronics" })`
2. Finding products within a price range: `db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 10, $lt: 100 } })`
3. Finding products by name (partial match): `db.products.find({ name: /laptop/i })`

**Step 1: Identify and Analyze Queries**

First, use MongoDB's profiling tools to monitor query performance.  This helps pinpoint bottlenecks and identify the queries that need optimization. (See references below for profiling documentation.)

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Before adding new ones, we remove the unnecessary indexes.  We can list current indexes with:

```bash
db.products.getIndexes()
```

Then, identify indexes not used frequently or those that provide negligible performance improvement.  Remove them using `db.products.dropIndex()`:

```javascript
// Assuming the output of getIndexes() shows unnecessary indexes
db.products.dropIndex("name_1"); // Removes index on "name" field
db.products.dropIndex({"brand":1, "price":-1}); // Removes a compound index
```

**Step 3: Create Efficient Indexes**

Create indexes specifically designed for frequent query patterns:


```javascript
// Index for category search
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )

// Index for price range search
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )

// Index for text search on name (case-insensitive)
db.products.createIndex( { name: "text" }, { default_language: "english" })
```

**Step 4: Verify Performance Improvement**

After implementing these changes, re-run performance tests to confirm improvements in insertion speed and query response times.  Use the MongoDB profiler or benchmarking tools to measure the impact.


## Explanation

Over-indexing slows down write operations because the database needs to update all indexes whenever a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  For read operations, while indexes help with speed, poorly chosen indexes might force MongoDB to perform a full collection scan, negating the benefits. The key is to strategically choose indexes that support the most frequent and crucial queries, prioritizing those with high selectivity (returning a smaller subset of the data).
