# üêû Creating a CSS-only Expanding Card with a Subtle Reveal


This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth and visually appealing animation.  This example is achievable with plain CSS3, though similar effects can be more easily styled with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

## Description of the Styling

The styling creates a card that expands vertically when hovered over. The expansion is accompanied by a subtle opacity change on the card's content, creating a sense of depth and revealing the content gradually.  The card itself uses a simple box-shadow for visual enhancement.

## Full Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content overflow during expansion */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
  width: 200px;
}

.card:hover {
  height: 200px; /* Expanded height */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  opacity: 0.8; /* Initial opacity */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth opacity transition */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  opacity: 1; /* Full opacity on hover */
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3 class="card-title">My Expanding Card</h3>
    <p>This is some example text inside the card.  It will smoothly appear as you hover over the card.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Explanation

* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card element.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from overflowing during the expansion. The `transition` property defines smooth animations for height and opacity.  The initial height is set to 100px.

* **`.card:hover`**: This selector applies styles when the mouse hovers over the card.  The height is increased to 200px on hover.

* **`.card-content`**: Styles the inner content of the card. The initial `opacity` is set to 0.8, creating a subtle fade-in effect.  The `transition` property ensures a smooth opacity change.

* **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This targets the `.card-content` element *only* when the parent `.card` is hovered over,  changing the opacity to 1 (fully visible).
