# üêû Overcoming the "Index Interleaving" Problem in MongoDB


## Description of the Error

Index interleaving in MongoDB occurs when multiple indexes are used concurrently on the same collection, and the query optimizer chooses a suboptimal execution plan. This leads to performance degradation, sometimes significantly impacting query speed. Instead of efficiently utilizing a single index, the query might perform multiple index scans, resulting in increased I/O operations and processing overhead.  This often happens with complex queries involving multiple fields and conditions, especially when those fields are indexed separately. The symptoms include slower query times than expected, even with relevant indexes present.


## Fixing Index Interleaving Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates fixing index interleaving impacting a collection named "products" with fields `category`, `price`, and `brand`.

**Scenario:** We have separate indexes for `category`, `price`, and `brand`, and a query needs to filter by `category` and `price` concurrently.


**Step 1: Identify the Problem**

First, we need to identify if index interleaving is the cause of slow query performance. We'll use the MongoDB profiler to analyze query execution plans.  Enable profiling (if not already enabled) and run your problematic query.  Then inspect the profiler output. Look for multiple `IXSCAN` (Index Scan) operations in the profile output indicating multiple indexes are being used for a single query.

```bash
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enables profiling level 2 (all operations)
db.products.find({ category: "Electronics", price: { $lt: 100 } })
db.system.profile.find() // Inspect the profiler output
db.setProfilingLevel(0) //Disable profiling after inspection
```

**Step 2: Create a Compound Index**

The most effective solution is usually to create a compound index covering the fields used in the query.  This allows MongoDB to efficiently utilize a single index instead of multiple scans.

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

This creates a compound index on `category` and `price` in ascending order (indicated by `1`). The order matters; if your query frequently uses range conditions on `price`, it should be the last field in the compound index.

**Step 3:  Review and Optimize**

After creating the compound index, rerun your query and check the query execution time and profiler output again.  The `IXSCAN` operation should now only show a single scan on the compound index.  If performance is still suboptimal, consider other optimization techniques, like analyzing query selectivity or optimizing data model.

**Step 4 (Optional): Drop Redundant Indexes**

If separate indexes on `category` and `price` are no longer needed given the compound index, you can drop them to improve storage efficiency and reduce overhead:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { price: 1 } )
```


## Explanation

Index interleaving results from the query optimizer trying to determine the most efficient execution plan. When dealing with multiple indexes and complex queries, it might make suboptimal choices. A compound index provides a single structure containing all the necessary fields to satisfy the query conditions, hence reducing the need for multiple index scans. The order within the compound index influences performance based on which fields have range conditions.
