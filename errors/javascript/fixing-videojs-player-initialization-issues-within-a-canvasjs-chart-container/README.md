# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Initialization Issues within a CanvasJS Chart Container


## Description of the Error

A common issue when integrating a VideoJS player into a webpage that also utilizes CanvasJS charts involves the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render correctly within a CanvasJS chart's container. This often manifests as a blank space where the video player should be, or as JavaScript errors related to DOM element access or player initialization failures.  The root cause is usually a conflict in how both libraries manage the DOM, particularly when the VideoJS player's container element isn't fully rendered or accessible when VideoJS attempts to initialize.  CanvasJS, especially if dynamically updating charts, might render its container after the VideoJS initialization script runs.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example assumes you're using the latest versions of VideoJS and CanvasJS. Adjust paths as needed.

**1. Ensure correct library inclusion:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>VideoJS in CanvasJS</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
<style>
  #myChartContainer {
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myChartContainer">
  <video id="myVideo" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="600" height="300" data-setup="{}"></video>
</div>

<script>
  // CanvasJS Chart code (replace with your actual chart code)
  window.onload = function () {
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("myChartContainer", {
      title: {
        text: "My Chart"
      },
      data: [{
        type: "column",
        dataPoints: [
          { x: 10, y: 71 },
          { x: 20, y: 55 },
          { x: 30, y: 50 },
          { x: 40, y: 65 },
          { x: 50, y: 95 }
        ]
      }]
    });
    chart.render();

    // Initialize VideoJS *after* the chart has rendered
    setTimeout(function(){
        videojs('myVideo');
    }, 500); // Wait 500 milliseconds to ensure CanvasJS has rendered
  };
</script>

</body>
</html>
```


**2.  Delayed VideoJS Initialization:**

The key change is the `setTimeout` function.  This delays the VideoJS player initialization. CanvasJS chart rendering takes a small amount of time; the `setTimeout` ensures that the `myChartContainer` div is fully ready and populated before VideoJS attempts to access and use it as a parent container.  Experiment with the delay time (500ms here) to find what works best based on your chart's complexity and browser performance.

**3.  Alternative: Event Listener:**

A more robust method uses a CanvasJS event listener to detect when the chart is fully rendered:

```javascript
// ... (CanvasJS chart code) ...
chart.render();

chart.options.data[0].dataPoints.push({x: 60, y: 80}); // Example of data point add to force redraw
chart.render(); //Force a redraw

chart.on("dataAnimationEnd", function(){
  videojs('myVideo');
});

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

This ensures the VideoJS player initializes only after CanvasJS is done rendering and the DOM is stable, avoiding conflicts.


## Explanation

The issue stems from a timing conflict between the rendering of the CanvasJS chart and the initialization of the VideoJS player. If VideoJS tries to initialize before the CanvasJS chart has fully rendered the container element (`myChartContainer`), it won't find the correct DOM element, resulting in failure.  The `setTimeout` or `dataAnimationEnd` event listener provides a simple way to ensure that the VideoJS player initialization is delayed until the chart's container is ready.
