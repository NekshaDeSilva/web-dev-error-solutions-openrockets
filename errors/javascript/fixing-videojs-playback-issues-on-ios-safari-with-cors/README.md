# üêû Fixing VideoJS Playback Issues on iOS Safari with CORS


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using Video.js to play videos in iOS Safari is playback failure due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.  Even if your server is correctly configured with CORS headers, iOS Safari can be particularly stringent, often failing silently without providing clear error messages in the browser's console. This results in a blank video player or an error that mentions a network issue, but doesn't pinpoint the root cause as CORS.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This issue often arises when the video source's origin differs from the webpage's origin.  The solution involves ensuring your server correctly sends the necessary CORS headers and, in some cases, potentially using a proxy.  Let's assume your Video.js player is initialized like this:

**Incorrect (Problem) Code:**

```javascript
// Using a video source from a different domain
var myPlayer = videojs('my-video', {
  sources: [{
    src: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
    type: 'video/mp4'
  }]
}, function() {
  // Player is ready
});
```

**Correct (Solution) Code:**

**1. Server-Side Configuration:** The most important step is ensuring your server (example.com in this case) is properly configured to allow requests from your website's domain.  This involves adding the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to your server's response. For example, in Apache:

```apache
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</Directory>
```
**Note:** While `*` allows all origins, it's generally safer to specify the exact origin of your website (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://yourwebsite.com`).  Always prioritize security best practices.

**2.  Proxy (If Server-Side Configuration isn't possible):** If you cannot modify the server sending the video, a proxy solution on your website might be necessary. This involves setting up a server (even a simple Node.js or Python server) that fetches the video and then sends it to your Video.js player.  The proxy server will handle the CORS issue.  This is a more complex solution and requires additional server setup.

**3.  Verify using browser's developer tools:** After implementing the server-side fix, use your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) to check the Network tab.  Look for any CORS related errors in the console. If the fix is successful, you should see the video playing without any network errors.

## Explanation

iOS Safari's strict adherence to the CORS policy requires that the server serving the video explicitly allows your website to access it. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header communicates this permission.  If this header is missing or incorrect, iOS Safari will block the request, leading to playback failure.  Using a proxy acts as an intermediary, allowing your website to make a request to the proxy, which then requests the video and forwards it.  This bypasses the direct CORS issue but adds complexity.
