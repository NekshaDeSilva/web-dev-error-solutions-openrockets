# üêû Troubleshooting "ReferenceError: process is not defined" in Next.js


This document addresses the common "ReferenceError: process is not defined" error encountered in Next.js applications, particularly when using packages that rely on Node.js's `process` global object within the browser environment.  This error arises because the `process` object is a Node.js global, not available in the browser's JavaScript environment.

## Description of the Error

The error message "ReferenceError: process is not defined" appears in your browser's console when your Next.js application tries to access the `process` object during client-side rendering (CSR) or at runtime within the browser. This typically happens when using libraries or code that directly depends on `process` functionalities, such as accessing environment variables using `process.env`.

## Code and Step-by-Step Fix

Let's assume you're using a library that utilizes `process.env.MY_VARIABLE`.

**Problem Code (Incorrect):**

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import MyLibrary from 'my-library';

export default function Home() {
  const myVariable = process.env.MY_VARIABLE; // This line causes the error in the browser.
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Variable: {myVariable}</h1>
      <MyLibrary />
    </div>
  );
}
```


**Solution:**

The correct approach involves separating server-side logic (where `process` is defined) from client-side logic. You can achieve this using Next.js's `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` functions for data fetching and environment variable access.

**Corrected Code (Using getServerSideProps):**

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import MyLibrary from 'my-library';

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const myVariable = process.env.MY_VARIABLE;
  return {
    props: {
      myVariable,
    },
  };
}

export default function Home({ myVariable }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Variable: {myVariable}</h1>
      <MyLibrary />
    </div>
  );
}

```

This revised code fetches `process.env.MY_VARIABLE` on the server during the `getServerSideProps` execution. The value is then passed as a prop to the `Home` component, making it available on the client-side without directly accessing the `process` object.  Remember to define `MY_VARIABLE` in your `.env.local` file (or appropriate environment file).


## Explanation

The `process` object is a core Node.js global object that provides information about the current Node.js process.  It is not available in the browser's JavaScript runtime environment.  Next.js's data fetching methods, `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`, allow you to execute code on the server, where the `process` object is available, and pass the results to your components for client-side rendering.  This neatly separates server-side and client-side logic, preventing runtime errors.
