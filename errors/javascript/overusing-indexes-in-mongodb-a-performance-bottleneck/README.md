# üêû Overusing Indexes in MongoDB: A Performance Bottleneck


This document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB: overusing indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, excessive or poorly designed indexes can negatively impact write performance and database size.  This can lead to slower application speeds and increased infrastructure costs.

## Description of the Error

Over-indexing occurs when you create too many indexes or indexes on fields that are rarely used in queries.  Every time you write data to a collection, MongoDB must update all relevant indexes.  With numerous indexes, this update process becomes a significant overhead, slowing down write operations (inserts, updates, deletes). Additionally, each index consumes disk space, potentially leading to larger database sizes and higher storage costs.  The symptoms can manifest as slow write performance, increased storage costs, and potentially slower read performance if the overhead from index maintenance outweighs the benefits of faster lookups.

## Code Example & Fixing Steps

Let's assume we have a collection named `products` with fields like `name`, `category`, `price`, `description`, and `tags` (an array).  We've created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `tags`.  However, only queries on `name` and `category` are frequent.

**Problematic Scenario (Over-indexed):**

```javascript
// This code shows creating excessive indexes
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { description: 1 } ) // Rarely used in queries
db.products.createIndex( { "tags": 1 } ) // Rarely used in queries. Might be better as a compound index if frequently queried with another field.

```

**Fixing Steps:**

1. **Identify Unnecessary Indexes:** Analyze your application's query patterns using MongoDB's profiling tools (e.g., `db.setProfilingLevel(2)`) or monitoring tools. This will reveal which indexes are frequently used and which are seldom accessed.

2. **Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**  Drop indexes that are not utilized significantly.

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } )
db.products.dropIndex( { tags: 1 } )
```

3. **Optimize Existing Indexes:** Consider compound indexes if you frequently query on multiple fields together.  A compound index on `category` and `price` would be more efficient than separate indexes on `category` and `price` for queries that involve both fields.


```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } ) // Compound index
```

4. **Monitor Performance:** After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor your application's performance to ensure the changes have improved write performance without sacrificing read performance for essential queries.


## Explanation

Over-indexing slows down write operations because every write needs to update all relevant indexes.  The more indexes, the more updates and thus the slower the write speed.  This becomes particularly problematic in high-write environments.  Furthermore, excessive indexes unnecessarily consume storage space.  Careful analysis of query patterns and strategic index creation are critical for optimizing MongoDB performance.
