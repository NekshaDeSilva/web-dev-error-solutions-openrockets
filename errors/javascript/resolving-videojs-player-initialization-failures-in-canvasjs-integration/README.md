# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failures in CanvasJS Integration


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart visualization.  The problem often manifests as a failure to initialize the VideoJS player, resulting in a blank space where the player should be, or throwing JavaScript errors related to player instantiation or element access. This is frequently due to timing issues or incorrect DOM manipulation, especially when the VideoJS player relies on elements dynamically added or modified by CanvasJS.


## Description of the Error

The error typically doesn't produce a consistent error message. Instead, you might see:

* A blank space where the VideoJS player should be.
* JavaScript errors related to `undefined` or `null` values when accessing VideoJS player elements or methods.
* Errors indicating that the VideoJS player couldn't find the target element.
* Console errors mentioning `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'player')` or similar.


## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

This example assumes you're using a basic VideoJS setup within a CanvasJS chart's container. We'll address the common problem of the VideoJS player not initializing because the CanvasJS chart hasn't fully rendered its container element before the player is initialized.

**Step 1: Ensure CanvasJS has finished rendering.**

We'll use the `afterSetOptions` callback provided by CanvasJS to ensure the player is initialized after the chart is completely rendered.

```javascript
// Assuming 'chartContainer' is the ID of your div for the CanvasJS chart
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...
  afterSetOptions: function() {
    initializeVideoJS();
  }
});

chart.render();

function initializeVideoJS() {
  // Step 2: Get the video container element.
  const videoContainer = document.getElementById('video-container');

  // Step 3: Check if the element exists before initializing VideoJS.
  if (videoContainer) {
    // Initialize VideoJS player
    videojs('video-container', {
        sources: [{ src: 'your-video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],
        // ... other VideoJS options ...
    }, function() {
        // Player is ready
        console.log('VideoJS player is ready!');
    });
  } else {
      console.error("Video container element not found!");
  }
}

```

**Step 2: Create a dedicated container for the VideoJS player within the CanvasJS container.**

Make sure to include a `<div>` element with the ID 'video-container' within the div element containing the chart.


```html
<div id="chartContainer">
    <div id="video-container"></div>
</div>

<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
</script>
```


## Explanation

The key to solving this problem is ensuring that the element targeted by the VideoJS player (`video-container` in this example) exists and is accessible in the DOM *before* VideoJS attempts to initialize the player.  The CanvasJS `afterSetOptions` callback provides a reliable way to ensure this.  Adding a check to ensure the element exists before initializing prevents errors if something goes wrong with the DOM manipulation, for instance, if the container ID is incorrect.  This approach avoids race conditions between the CanvasJS rendering process and the VideoJS player initialization.
