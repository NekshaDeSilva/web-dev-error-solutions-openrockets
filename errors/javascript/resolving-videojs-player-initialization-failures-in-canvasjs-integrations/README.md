# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failures in CanvasJS Integrations


This document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating Video.js with CanvasJS charts:  failure to initialize the Video.js player within a CanvasJS chart container, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be. This usually stems from a timing issue where the Video.js player attempts to initialize before the CanvasJS chart's container element is fully rendered.


**Description of the Error:**

The most common symptom is a blank area where the Video.js player should be displayed within a CanvasJS chart.  The browser's developer console may show no errors, or it might show errors related to Video.js not finding its container element,  or errors related to the player's dimensions being incorrect (0x0). This happens because the Video.js player initialization code executes before the CanvasJS chart's rendering process is complete, leading to an invalid or missing container element.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume you have a CanvasJS chart that includes a `div` element intended to hold the Video.js player.  We'll fix this using a `setTimeout` function to ensure the Video.js initialization occurs *after* the CanvasJS chart has rendered.

```javascript
// Include necessary Video.js and CanvasJS libraries.  Make sure you have the correct paths.
// <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7"></script> //Or your preferred CDN
// <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>


window.onload = function() {
  // CanvasJS chart setup
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    // Your CanvasJS chart configuration here...
    title: {
      text: "My Chart with Video.js Player"
    },
    data: [/* Your data points */]
  });
  chart.render();


  // Video.js player setup (using setTimeout for delayed initialization)
  setTimeout(function() {
    var playerOptions = {
      autoplay: false,
      controls: true,
      sources: [{
        src: "your_video.mp4",
        type: "video/mp4"
      }]
    };

    var videoPlayer = videojs('videoContainer', playerOptions);

    //Optional: Handle VideoJS events
    videoPlayer.on('loadeddata', function(){
      console.log("Video Loaded!");
    })

    videoPlayer.on('error', function(error){
      console.error("Video Error:", error);
    })

  }, 500); // Adjust the delay (in milliseconds) as needed.
};


// HTML Structure (Make sure the IDs match your JavaScript code)
// <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 600px;"></div>
// <div id="videoContainer" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;"></div>
```


**Explanation:**

The crucial change is the use of `setTimeout`.  This function delays the execution of the Video.js initialization code by 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds). This provides sufficient time for the CanvasJS chart to render completely, ensuring that the `videoContainer` div element exists and is properly sized before Video.js attempts to create the player.  You might need to adjust the delay (500ms) depending on the complexity of your chart and the speed of your user's machine. Consider using a more robust method like an event listener for the chart's `render` event if available.
