# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Errors on CanvasJS Integration


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart visualization.  The error typically manifests as the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render properly, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be. This is frequently caused by conflicts in JavaScript libraries or incorrect DOM manipulation.  We'll address a scenario where the VideoJS player's initialization is delayed due to the CanvasJS chart rendering asynchronously.

**Description of the Error:**

The VideoJS player fails to render, showing a blank area where the player should appear.  Browser console might show no errors, or possibly generic errors related to DOM element access or script loading conflicts.  This happens when `videojs()` is called before the DOM element it targets is fully rendered.  The CanvasJS chart might be asynchronously loading and rendering its elements, delaying the availability of the VideoJS container element.

**Code Example (Problematic):**

```javascript
// CanvasJS chart setup (async rendering)
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...
});
chart.render();

// VideoJS player setup (too early!)
var player = videojs('myVideoPlayer', {
  // ... your VideoJS options ...
});
```

**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

This solution ensures VideoJS initialization only occurs after the CanvasJS chart has completely rendered. We'll use CanvasJS's `render` event:

```javascript
// CanvasJS chart setup (with render event handler)
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...
});

chart.render();

chart.options.animationEnabled = true; //Ensure animation is enabled

chart.on("dataAnimationEnd", function(){ //Adding event listner after data animation completes 
    // VideoJS player setup (now safe to initialize)
    var player = videojs('myVideoPlayer', {
      sources: [{ src: 'your-video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],
      autoplay: false,
      controls: true,
      // ... other VideoJS options ...
    });
  });

```

**Explanation:**

The key change is using the `dataAnimationEnd` event of the CanvasJS chart.  This event fires only after the chart's animation is fully complete and all elements are rendered in the DOM. By placing the `videojs()` initialization call within the `dataAnimationEnd` event handler, we guarantee that the required DOM element (`myVideoPlayer`) exists and is ready for VideoJS to use it.

**Important Considerations:**

- Ensure your HTML includes the correct `<video>` element with the ID "myVideoPlayer" within the `chartContainer` div or a parent container.
- Verify the paths to your VideoJS and CanvasJS libraries are correct.
- Check the browser's developer console for any additional errors that might be occurring.
- Consider using a promise or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the chart rendering if preferred instead of the chart event.
