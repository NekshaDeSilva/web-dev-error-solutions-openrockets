# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Autoplay Issues on Mobile Devices


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using Video.js is the failure of autoplay to function correctly on mobile devices (iOS and Android).  While autoplay might work fine on desktop browsers, mobile browsers often block autoplay due to user preference settings and power consumption considerations.  This results in a silent video player, with no video playing automatically upon page load.  The user is then required to manually initiate playback.  This is frustrating for the user experience and might lead to lower engagement.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

The solution involves utilizing the `autoplay` attribute correctly in conjunction with user interaction.  Mobile browsers generally allow autoplay if the user has already interacted with the page. We'll achieve this by triggering the `play()` method after a user event, like a click.

**Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video.js Autoplay Fix</title>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js"></script>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup='{ "autoplay": true }'>
    <source src="myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">

    </p>
  </video>

  <button id="playButton">Play Video</button>

  <script>
    const player = videojs('my-video');
    const playButton = document.getElementById('playButton');

    playButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
      player.play();
    });

    //Optional:  Handle potential play() errors (e.g., permission denied)
    player.on('error', (error) => {
      console.error("Video.js error:", error);
      //Add your error handling logic here, like displaying a message to the user
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Include Video.js:** We include the Video.js library via CDN links in the `<head>`. Remember to replace `"myvideo.mp4"` and `"poster.jpg"` with your actual video and poster image URLs.

2. **`data-setup` Attribute:**  The `data-setup` attribute allows us to initialize Video.js options. While `autoplay: true` is set,  mobile browsers will likely ignore it initially.

3. **Play Button:** A button is added to provide a user interaction trigger.

4. **Event Listener:**  An event listener on the button's `click` event calls the `player.play()` method, initiating playback after user interaction.  This bypasses the mobile browser's autoplay restrictions.

5. **Error Handling:** The `player.on('error', ...)` section demonstrates how to add basic error handling.  This is crucial for a robust implementation.
