# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Errors in CanvasJS Charts


## Description of the Error

A common issue developers encounter when integrating VideoJS within a CanvasJS chart visualization involves player initialization failures.  This often manifests as a blank space where the VideoJS player should be, or JavaScript console errors related to `VideoJS` being undefined or failing to find the target element.  This is usually caused by conflicts in the order of loading JavaScript libraries or issues with element visibility and timing when the VideoJS player attempts to initialize within a dynamically-generated or hidden CanvasJS chart container.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example demonstrates integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart. We'll address the common initialization problem by ensuring the chart is fully rendered before attempting to initialize the VideoJS player.

**1. Include necessary libraries:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>VideoJS in CanvasJS</title>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>  <!-- CanvasJS -->
<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>      <!-- VideoJS -->
<link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!-- VideoJS CSS -->
</head>
<body>
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
<script>
//CanvasJS Chart Code
window.onload = function () {
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    animationEnabled: true,
    title:{
      text: "Chart with VideoJS"
    },
    data: [{
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [
        { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
        { label: "Orange", y: 15  },
        { label: "Banana", y: 25  }
      ]
    }]
  });
  chart.render();


  // Wait for chart to render before initializing VideoJS
  setTimeout(function() {
    var video = videojs('my-video');
  }, 500); // Adjust timeout as needed depending on chart rendering time

};


</script>

<video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="264" poster="https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png" data-setup="{}">
  <source src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <p class="vjs-no-js">

  </p>
</video>
</body>
</html>

```

**2. Explanation:**

The crucial part is the `setTimeout` function. This ensures that the VideoJS player (`videojs('my-video')`) is initialized *after* the CanvasJS chart has completed rendering.  Without this delay, the `#my-video` element may not be available or fully rendered in the DOM when VideoJS attempts to find and initialize it, leading to the initialization error. The 500ms delay is arbitrary; you might need to adjust it based on the complexity of your chart and the performance of the browser. Consider using a more robust approach like listening to a render complete event if available in the Chart library.
