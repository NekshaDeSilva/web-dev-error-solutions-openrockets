# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Issues within a CanvasJS Chart Overlay


This document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within or overlaid on a CanvasJS chart: **failure to initialize the VideoJS player correctly, often resulting in a blank player container or rendering errors.** This typically occurs when the VideoJS player's initialization depends on the chart's DOM element being fully rendered or when there are conflicts between their respective JavaScript libraries.


**Description of the Error:**

The VideoJS player will fail to initialize, leaving the designated container area blank or displaying error messages in the browser's console. This might manifest as a completely unresponsive player, a missing video element, or unexpected layout issues.  The error might not be immediately apparent in the browser's console, requiring careful inspection of the VideoJS logs or network requests.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

This example assumes you have both CanvasJS and VideoJS included in your project.  We'll address initialization using a common pattern of deferring VideoJS initialization until after the CanvasJS chart is fully rendered.

<script>
  window.onload = function () {
    // CanvasJS chart initialization
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
      // Your CanvasJS chart configuration here...
      data: [{
        type: "line",
        dataPoints: [
          { x: 10, y: 10 },
          { x: 20, y: 15 },
          { x: 30, y: 25 }
        ]
      }]
    });
    chart.render();

    // VideoJS initialization after CanvasJS chart rendering
    setTimeout(function() {
      videojs('myVideo');
    }, 100); // Adjust the timeout as needed.
  };
</script>
</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

The key to the solution is the use of `setTimeout`.  The CanvasJS chart's `render()` method might not immediately update the DOM. This means that when VideoJS attempts to initialize, the element it's targeting (`#myVideo`) might not be fully available or rendered within the page layout.  The `setTimeout` function provides a small delay (100 milliseconds in this example) allowing the CanvasJS chart rendering to complete before initializing the VideoJS player.  You might need to adjust the timeout value depending on the complexity of your chart and the speed of your browser.
