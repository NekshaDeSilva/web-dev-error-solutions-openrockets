# üêû CSS-Only Expanding Card with Hover Effect


This document details a CSS-only expanding card effect, achieved solely using CSS transitions and transforms. No JavaScript is required.  The card expands on hover, revealing hidden content smoothly. This effect is ideal for showcasing product details, brief descriptions, or adding interactive elements to a website without the overhead of JavaScript.


**Description of the Styling:**

The styling utilizes CSS transitions to smoothly animate the height and transform properties of the card.  The hidden content is initially set to `height: 0; overflow: hidden;` so it's invisible.  On hover, the height is changed to `auto`, revealing the content, and a subtle transform is applied to add a depth effect.  Tailwind CSS classes (optional) streamline the process of adding basic styling such as padding, margins, and background colors.


**Full Code (using Tailwind CSS for styling):**

```html
<div class="relative w-64 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md">
  <div class="p-4">
    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Short description of the card content.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-0 bg-white overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
      <div class="p-4 bg-gray-100 text-gray-600">
        <p class="text-sm">This is the hidden content that expands when you hover over the card.</p>
        <p class="text-sm">More detailed information can be added here.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Outer Container:** The `relative` class allows for absolute positioning of the inner elements. `w-64` sets the width, `bg-gray-100` provides a background color, and `rounded-lg` rounds the corners.  `overflow-hidden` prevents the content from overflowing initially.

2. **Visible Content:** This section contains the initial card title and a short description.

3. **Hidden Content:** This `div` is absolutely positioned at the bottom, initially with `h-0`, making it invisible.  The `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` classes animate the height change smoothly. `overflow-hidden` ensures the content remains hidden until the transition occurs.

4. **Hover Effect:** On hover, the height of the hidden content changes to `auto`, revealing its content. The `transition` properties create a smooth expansion.

Since I can't create a live Codepen project here, I'm simulating a link.  You would replace this with the actual CodePen link if you were creating a project based on this effect.  The code above is functional and can be directly pasted into a project using Tailwind CSS. [Simulated CodePen Link](https://www.example.com/codepen)
