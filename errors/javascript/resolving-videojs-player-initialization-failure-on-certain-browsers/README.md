# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failure on Certain Browsers


## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when integrating VideoJS into a web application is the failure to initialize the player on specific browsers, often older versions or those with less robust JavaScript support. This usually manifests as a blank space where the player should be, with no error messages in the browser's developer console, or cryptic messages related to DOM manipulation or object creation failures.  The player's `ready` event might not fire, preventing your application from interacting with it. This problem is frequently exacerbated when using custom themes or plugins, as conflicts can arise.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example focuses on a scenario where VideoJS fails to initialize due to a missing or improperly loaded dependency, a common cause.  We'll assume the problem stems from a faulty inclusion of the VideoJS CSS file.

**Original (Problematic) Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>VideoJS Example</title>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js"></script>  <!-- JS library -->
  <link href="video-js.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!-- INCORRECT CSS PATH -->
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
         poster="my-poster.jpg" data-setup='{}'>
    <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p>
  </video>
  <script>
    var player = videojs('my-video');
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Corrected Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>VideoJS Example</title>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js"></script>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!-- CORRECTED CSS PATH -->
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
         poster="my-poster.jpg" data-setup='{}'>
    <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p>
  </video>
  <script>
    var player = videojs('my-video');
    player.ready(function(){
        console.log("Player is ready!");
        // Add your player controls and other functionalities here.
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The correction involves using the CDN-hosted CSS file instead of a potentially incorrectly configured local path.  We also added a `ready` event listener to ensure the player is fully initialized before attempting to interact with it.


## Explanation

The original code likely failed because the path to the `video-js.css` file was incorrect. This prevented the player from loading its necessary styles, leading to a dysfunctional or invisible player.  Using the CDN-hosted version ensures that the correct CSS file is always available.  The `ready` event listener helps in avoiding errors caused by trying to interact with the player before it's fully initialized.
