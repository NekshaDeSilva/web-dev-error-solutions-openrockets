# üêû Resolving CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in a Responsive Layout


## Description of the Error

A common problem when integrating CanvasJS charts into responsive web designs is the chart failing to render correctly or resizing properly as the browser window is resized. This often manifests as a chart that is either cut off, displays incorrectly scaled, or remains static despite changes in viewport dimensions.  The issue stems from a mismatch between the chart's container size and the available space, especially when using percentage-based widths and heights.  CanvasJS needs accurate dimensions to render properly.

## Fixing Step-by-Step

This solution utilizes a combination of JavaScript and ensuring the chart's container has the correct dimensions before the chart is rendered.  We'll use a `window.addEventListener` to detect resize events.

**Step 1:  Include CanvasJS:**

First, ensure you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file. You can download it from their official website:

```html
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
```

Replace `"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"` with the actual path to your downloaded file if necessary.


**Step 2: HTML Structure:**

Create a container div to hold your chart.  Using a `div` with an `id` is crucial for CanvasJS to target it:

```html
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
```

**Step 3: JavaScript Implementation:**

This JavaScript code will handle chart creation and resizing:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  renderChart();
});

function renderChart() {
  //Get the container element.  We use querySelector to ensure we grab the element after any potential page re-rendering caused by a resize event.
  const chartContainer = document.querySelector('#chartContainer');

  // Get the container's updated dimensions after resize
  const containerWidth = chartContainer.offsetWidth;
  const containerHeight = chartContainer.offsetHeight;


  // CanvasJS Chart Configuration.  Replace with your actual data.
  const chartData = {
    animationEnabled: true,
    title: {
      text: "Responsive Chart"
    },
    data: [{
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [
        { label: "Apple", y: 10 },
        { label: "Orange", y: 15 },
        { label: "Banana", y: 25 }
      ]
    }]
  };

  //Check if a chart already exists before creating a new one to prevent memory leaks.
  if (window.chart){
    window.chart.destroy();
  }
  // Create the chart, using the updated dimensions
  window.chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    height: containerHeight,
    width: containerWidth,
    ...chartData
  });

  window.chart.render();
}

// Initial chart render
renderChart();
```

## Explanation

The key improvements in this solution are:

* **`window.addEventListener('resize', renderChart)`:** This ensures the chart is re-rendered whenever the browser window is resized.  The `renderChart` function is called on window resize.
* **`offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight`:** These properties retrieve the *actual* rendered width and height of the `#chartContainer` div, accounting for any changes due to responsiveness.  This is crucial as using percentage-based height/width in CSS might not provide immediately-available values during initial page render.
* **`chart.destroy()`:** This line ensures that if the chart already exists, it is destroyed before a new one is created. This prevents multiple charts from being rendered, which can lead to performance issues and memory leaks.
* **Initial render call `renderChart()`:**  This ensures the chart is rendered when the page initially loads.
