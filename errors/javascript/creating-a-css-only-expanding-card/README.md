# üêû Creating a CSS-only Expanding Card


This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  This effect uses CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing expansion when the card is hovered over.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card is initially displayed in a compact state. On hover, the card expands horizontally, revealing more content.  This is achieved using CSS transitions on the `transform` property (for scaling) and `width` property (for horizontal expansion).  The transition provides a smooth animation effect.  We utilize pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) for decorative purposes, such as a subtle background shadow.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */
  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of pseudo-elements */
}

.card:hover {
  width: 400px;
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Subtle zoom effect */
}

.card::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  z-index: -1; /* Place behind the card */
  border-radius: 5px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.card:hover::before {
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3>Expanding Card</h3>
    <p>This is some sample text within the card.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`transition` property:** This property is crucial for the animation. It specifies which properties (`width`, `transform`) should transition smoothly, the duration (`0.3s`), and the easing function (`ease-in-out`).
* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This slightly scales up the card on hover, adding a subtle zoom effect.
* **`::before` pseudo-element:**  Creates a semi-transparent background layer behind the card, providing a shadow effect that also animates on hover.
* **`overflow: hidden;`:** Prevents content within the card from spilling outside the card boundaries during the expansion.
* **`position: relative;`:** Allows absolute positioning of pseudo-elements within the card.
