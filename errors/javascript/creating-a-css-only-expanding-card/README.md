# üêû Creating a CSS-only Expanding Card


This document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required.  The effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content. We'll be using plain CSS3 for this effect.

**Description of the Styling:**

The styling relies on the `transition` property for smooth animation and the `max-height` property to control the expansion.  Initially, the card has a limited `max-height`, hiding its inner content. On hover, the `max-height` is removed, allowing the content to expand to its natural height. We'll also use some basic styling for visual appeal.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows the max-height */
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  max-height: 100px; /* Initially, only show a part of the card */
}

.card:hover {
  max-height: 500px; /* Expand on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is some example text that will be hidden initially and revealed on hover.  You can add as much content as you need here.  The card will smoothly expand to accommodate it.</p>
    <p>More text to demonstrate the expanding effect.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`max-height: 100px;`:** This line limits the initial height of the card, hiding the majority of the content.  You can adjust this value to control the initially visible portion.

2. **`transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;`:** This crucial line enables the smooth animation.  `max-height` specifies the property to animate, `0.3s` sets the duration, and `ease-in-out` determines the timing function (a smoother transition).

3. **`max-height: 500px;` (in `:hover`):** On hover, the `max-height` is increased, allowing the content to expand.  You might need to adjust this value based on your content's height.  Alternatively, you could remove `max-height` entirely on hover (`max-height: initial;` or just omitting it) to let the content expand to its natural height.

4. **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the content from overflowing the card before expansion.
