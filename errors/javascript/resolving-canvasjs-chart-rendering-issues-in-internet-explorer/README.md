# üêû Resolving CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in Internet Explorer


## Description of the Error

A common issue faced by developers using CanvasJS in older browsers, specifically Internet Explorer (IE), is the failure of charts to render correctly or at all. This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should be, or as a partially rendered chart with missing elements.  This is primarily due to IE's limited support for modern JavaScript features and Canvas rendering capabilities. While CanvasJS officially supports only IE 11 and above, even in supported versions, compatibility issues can arise.  This problem is exacerbated if you're using older versions of CanvasJS itself or if there are conflicts with other libraries on the page.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on resolving rendering issues by ensuring compatibility and properly including the CanvasJS library.

**Step 1: Verify CanvasJS Inclusion and Version**

Ensure you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file.  Using a CDN is generally recommended for simplicity:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CanvasJS Chart</title>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script> </head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  <script>
    // Chart code will go here (see Step 2)
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Always use the latest stable version of CanvasJS.** Check the official website for updates.  Outdated versions may have unresolved IE compatibility bugs.


**Step 2:  Minimal Chart Code and Error Handling**

Start with the simplest possible chart configuration to isolate the problem.  Include basic error handling to catch potential issues during chart creation:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    animationEnabled: true,
    title:{
      text: "Simple Chart"
    },
    data: [{
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [
        { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
        { label: "Orange", y: 15  }
      ]
    }]
  });
  chart.render();

  //Basic error handling: check if chart rendered successfully.  
  if(chart.render){
    console.log("Chart rendered successfully!");
  } else{
    console.error("Chart rendering failed. Check browser compatibility and CanvasJS inclusion.");
  }
};
```

**Step 3:  Address potential CSS Conflicts**

Ensure there are no CSS rules that might interfere with the chart's container (`#chartContainer` in this example).  Conflicts can cause rendering issues.  Check for conflicting styles affecting the `width`, `height`, `position`, or `display` properties of the container.


**Step 4:  Consider using a Polyfill (if absolutely necessary)**

For extremely old IE versions (below IE11), consider using a polyfill to add support for missing features required by CanvasJS.  This is generally a last resort as it adds complexity and might not guarantee compatibility. Research polyfills specific to CanvasJS requirements or features that are failing.  However, supporting older browsers than IE11 is not recommended due to security vulnerabilities and lack of support from most modern frameworks.


## Explanation

The core reason for rendering failures in IE is the browser's limitations in handling modern web technologies. CanvasJS relies on relatively modern JavaScript and rendering techniques.  Older IE versions may lack the necessary support for these features.  By using a current CanvasJS version, error handling, and checking for CSS conflicts you can isolate and often resolve the problem. Using a polyfill should be viewed as a solution of last resort.
