# üêû Resolving CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in Internet Explorer


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts within older versions of Internet Explorer (IE) is the failure to render the chart correctly.  The chart might appear blank, partially rendered, or display broken elements. This is primarily due to IE's limited support for modern web technologies used by CanvasJS, especially in versions prior to IE11.  Error messages might be vague or absent in the browser's console.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This solution focuses on addressing rendering issues by using a combination of polyfills and conditional rendering.  We'll leverage the `excanvas` library (now somewhat outdated but still effective for older IE) to emulate the canvas element's functionality.

**1. Include the excanvas library:**

You'll need to include the `excanvas.js` library in your HTML file before including the CanvasJS script. You can download it from various sources (see External References).  Make sure the path is correct.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/excanvas@1.0.0/excanvas.min.js"></script>
```

**2.  Conditional Chart Rendering:**

We will use a JavaScript function to detect the browser and only initialize the CanvasJS chart if the browser is not an older version of IE. This prevents the chart from trying to render in incompatible environments and avoids potential errors.

```javascript
//Check if the browser is IE
function isIE() {
  const ua = window.navigator.userAgent;
  const msie = ua.indexOf('MSIE ');
  const trident = ua.indexOf('Trident/');
  return msie > 0 || trident > 0;
}

//Check if it is an older version of IE
function isOldIE() {
  const ua = window.navigator.userAgent;
  const msie = ua.indexOf('MSIE ');
  if (msie > 0) {
    const ver = parseInt(ua.substring(msie + 5, ua.indexOf('.', msie)));
    return ver < 9;  //consider versions before 9 as outdated
  }
  return false;
}

window.onload = function () {
  if (!isOldIE()) {
    //CanvasJS code goes here
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
      //Your CanvasJS chart configuration here...
      title:{
        text: "My Chart"
      },
      data: [
      {
        type: "column",
        dataPoints: [
          { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
          { label: "Orange", y: 15  },
          { label: "Banana", y: 25  }
        ]
      }
      ]
    });
    chart.render();
  } else {
    // Display a message or alternative content for older IE
    document.getElementById("chartContainer").innerHTML = "CanvasJS is not supported in this browser. Please update your browser.";
  }
};

```

**3.  Include the CanvasJS library:**

Remember to include the CanvasJS library itself after `excanvas.js`.

```html
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
```

**4. HTML Structure:**

Create a `div` element with the ID `chartContainer` where the chart will be rendered.

```html
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
```



## Explanation

The solution combines two strategies:

* **Polyfill (excanvas):** `excanvas` provides basic canvas functionality for older IE versions that lack native support. This allows CanvasJS to have a foundation to work upon.  However, it's crucial to understand that `excanvas` is limited and might not handle all CanvasJS features perfectly.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The JavaScript code checks the browser version.  If it's an older, unsupported version of IE, it prevents the CanvasJS chart from rendering and displays a user-friendly message instead. This avoids errors and a bad user experience.
