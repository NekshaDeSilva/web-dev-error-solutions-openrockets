# üêû Resolving CanvasJS Chart Rendering Issues in Internet Explorer


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers, particularly Internet Explorer (IE), is the failure of charts to render correctly or at all.  This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should be, or a partially rendered chart with missing elements. This is primarily due to CanvasJS's reliance on modern JavaScript features and canvas rendering techniques that might not be fully supported by older IE versions.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This solution focuses on addressing compatibility issues with older IE versions.  While upgrading to a modern browser is always the recommended approach, if you must support IE, these steps can help:

**Step 1: Include the Excanvas Library (for IE8 and below)**

IE8 and below lack native Canvas support.  The Excanvas library provides a polyfill, emulating the Canvas API.  You need to include it *before* the CanvasJS script.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>  <!-- CanvasJS script -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/excanvas/r3/excanvas.compiled.js"></script> <!-- Excanvas polyfill -->
<title>CanvasJS Chart</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  <script>
    window.onload = function () {
      var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        //Your chart configuration here... (see next step)
        title:{
          text: "My Chart"
        },
        data: [
          {
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
              { x: 10, y: 71 },
              { x: 20, y: 55 },
              { x: 30, y: 50 },
              { x: 40, y: 65 }
            ]
          }
        ]
      });
      chart.render();
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 2: Configure your CanvasJS Chart**

Replace the `//Your chart configuration here...` comment with your actual CanvasJS chart configuration.  This example shows a simple column chart.  Refer to the CanvasJS documentation for details on creating different chart types and customizing their appearance.


**Step 3:  Test Thoroughly**

Test your chart in various IE versions (if necessary) to ensure it renders correctly.  If issues persist, carefully review your chart configuration and check for any other potential conflicts with your webpage's code.

## Explanation

The core issue is the browser's inability to handle the Canvas API which CanvasJS relies on.  Excanvas acts as a bridge, making the Canvas API available in older IE versions.  This emulation isn't perfect and might impact performance, but it provides a way to render charts in these older browsers.  Modern browsers natively support the Canvas API, so Excanvas is generally unnecessary for them.
