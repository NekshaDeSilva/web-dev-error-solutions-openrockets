# üêû Creating a CSS-only Expanding Card with a Subtle Animation


This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. We'll achieve this using CSS transitions and transforms, resulting in a smooth and visually appealing animation.  This example uses plain CSS; adapting it to Tailwind CSS is straightforward by replacing class names with their Tailwind equivalents.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card starts with minimal dimensions. On hover, the card smoothly expands to a larger size, accompanied by a subtle shadow effect that adds depth. The transition is implemented using CSS transitions, ensuring a smooth animation.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 20px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for all properties */
  width: 200px; /* Initial width */
  height: 150px; /* Initial height */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */
}

.card:hover {
  width: 300px; /* Expanded width */
  height: 250px; /* Expanded height */
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */
  transform: translateY(-5px); /* Slight lift on hover */
}

.card-content {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>Hover over me!</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;`:** This line is crucial. It applies a transition to all CSS properties that change, making the animation smooth.  `0.3s` is the duration, and `ease-in-out` defines the timing function (how the speed changes during the transition).

* **`:hover` Selector:**  This selector targets the element when the mouse hovers over it.

* **`width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, `transform`:** These properties change on hover, creating the expansion and shadow effects. The `transform: translateY(-5px);` subtly lifts the card on hover, adding a nice visual touch.

* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is important to prevent the content inside the card from overflowing during the expansion animation.
