# 🐞 Resolving VideoJS Playback Issues with CORS in a CanvasJS Environment


## Description of the Error

A common problem when integrating VideoJS within a CanvasJS visualization or a webpage utilizing both libraries is encountering CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. This typically manifests as the video failing to load or play, often accompanied by error messages in the browser's developer console indicating that the request to load the video has been blocked due to CORS restrictions. This happens when your CanvasJS application (or the webpage) attempts to access video content from a different domain than the one it's served from.  For instance, if your CanvasJS chart is hosted on `example.com` but the video is hosted on `videoserver.net`, the browser will block the video loading unless proper CORS headers are set on the `videoserver.net` server.

## Fixing Step-by-Step Code

This example demonstrates fixing the issue by adding CORS headers to your video server. **You will need server-side access to implement this solution.**  Client-side workarounds are generally unreliable and insecure.

**1. Server-Side Configuration (Example using Node.js with Express):**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const path = require('path');

// ... other routes and middleware ...

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); // Serve static files, including your videos

app.get('/videos/*', (req, res) => {
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'public', req.params[0]); // Adjust path as needed
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Allow requests from any origin.  Consider restricting this to your actual domain for security!
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, OPTIONS');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Max-Age', '3600');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept');
  res.sendFile(filePath);
});


const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

**2. Client-Side VideoJS Integration (Example):**

This code assumes your video is located at `/videos/myvideo.mp4` relative to your server.  Adjust the source URL accordingly.  No changes are needed to the VideoJS code itself; the fix is entirely server-side.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>VideoJS with CanvasJS</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7"></script>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>

  <video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360" poster="poster.jpg">
    <source src="/videos/myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p>
  </video>

  <script>
    var player = videojs('my-video');
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

**3.  CanvasJS Integration:**

This step is independent of the CORS fix and depends on your specific CanvasJS implementation.  The corrected video player can be seamlessly integrated into your chart or dashboard.


## Explanation

The CORS error arises from the browser's security mechanism preventing requests from one domain to access resources from another. The server-side fix addresses this by adding HTTP headers that instruct the browser to allow the request.  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource; `*` allows all origins but should be replaced with your actual domain for improved security in a production environment. The other headers specify allowed methods, caching time, and allowed request headers.
