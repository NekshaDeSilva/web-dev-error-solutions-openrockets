# üêû Resolving VideoJS Playback Issues on iOS Safari due to CORS


This document addresses a common problem encountered when using VideoJS to play videos within an iOS Safari environment: playback failures due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.  These errors manifest as the video failing to load or playing only statically, often without any clear error message in the browser's console.

**Description of the Error:**

When a VideoJS player attempts to load a video from a different domain than the webpage hosting the player, the browser enforces CORS restrictions.  If the server hosting the video doesn't correctly set the appropriate CORS headers, the browser will block the request, preventing the video from playing.  This is particularly problematic on iOS Safari, which can be stricter with CORS enforcement than other browsers.


**Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step:**

The solution requires configuring the server hosting the video to send the correct CORS headers.  This usually involves adjusting the server's configuration file or adding middleware.  The specific steps depend on your server technology (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Node.js).  Here are examples for some common setups:


**1. Nginx Configuration:**

Add or modify the `location` block for your video files in your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf` or a similar file).  You'll need to replace `your_video_path` with the actual path to your video files.

```nginx
location ~* \.(mp4|mov|webm)$ {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*'; #Allows all origins - use with caution in production!
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' 'Content-Length,Content-Range';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' '86400';
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;  #This line is for static files, adjust based on your setup.
}
```

**Explanation of Nginx Headers:**

* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.  `*` allows all origins (less secure, use with caution in production; consider replacing with the specific origin of your website).  For production, replace `*` with your website's domain, e.g., `https://www.example.com`.
* `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`:  Specifies the allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS, etc.).
* `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Specifies which headers are allowed in the request.
* `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`:  Specifies which headers can be accessed by the client in the response.
* `Access-Control-Max-Age`:  Specifies how long (in seconds) the browser should cache the preflight OPTIONS request.


**2. Apache Configuration:**

Similar to Nginx, modify your Apache configuration file (usually `httpd.conf` or a `.htaccess` file) using `.htaccess`  (recommended for simplicity if allowed by your hosting provider):


```apache
<FilesMatch "\.(mp4|mov|webm)$">
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
  Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range"
  Header set Access-Control-Expose-Headers "Content-Length,Content-Range"
  Header set Access-Control-Max-Age "86400"
</FilesMatch>
```


**3. Node.js (Express.js Example):**

If you're using Node.js with Express.js, you can use middleware to add the headers:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); //Again, use with caution in production.
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range');
  res.header('Access-Control-Expose-Headers', 'Content-Length,Content-Range');
  res.header('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400');
  next();
});

// ... rest of your Express.js code ...
```

**Explanation:**

The core issue is the lack of communication between the client (your webpage with VideoJS) and the server hosting the video files regarding access permissions.  By setting the CORS headers, the server explicitly grants permission to the client to access the video, thereby resolving the playback issue.  Remember to restart your webserver after making these changes. Always prioritize security and avoid `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in a production environment.
