# 🐞 ## Issue: Unexpected Re-renders and Performance Degradation with useState and useEffect


**Description:**

We're experiencing significant performance issues in our application due to excessive re-renders triggered by seemingly innocuous `useState` updates and `useEffect` hooks.  Specifically, when updating a component's state using `useState`, the entire component tree below it re-renders, even when the changes are not relevant to the child components' logic or display. This is leading to noticeable lag and impacting user experience, particularly on less powerful devices.

**Example Scenario:**

We have a parent component `ParentComponent` that fetches data using `useEffect` and updates its state using `useState`. This state includes an array of items and a loading flag.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/items');
        const data = await response.json();
        setItems(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <ChildComponent items={items} />}
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

Even though `ChildComponent` only depends on the `items` array, it re-renders every time `isLoading` changes.  This unnecessary re-rendering becomes significantly more problematic as the component tree grows in complexity.

**Proposed Solutions/Questions:**

* Are we using `useState` and `useEffect` correctly in this scenario?
* Should we consider using `useMemo` or `useCallback` to optimize performance?  If so, how should we implement them in this specific context?
* Are there any other React best practices we should adopt to prevent this issue?
* Could React.memo be helpful here? If so how should it be implemented?

**Additional Information:**

* Browser(s): [List browsers affected]
* Any relevant code snippets that better illustrate the problem.

**Expected Behavior:**

Only the necessary components should re-render when their respective state changes.

**Actual Behavior:**

Unnecessary re-renders are occurring, causing performance degradation.


We would appreciate any guidance on resolving this common performance bottleneck.
