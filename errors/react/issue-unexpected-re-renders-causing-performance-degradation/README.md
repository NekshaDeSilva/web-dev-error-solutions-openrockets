# üêû ## Issue: Unexpected re-renders causing performance degradation


**Description:**

We're experiencing significant performance issues in our application, specifically related to excessive and unnecessary re-renders.  This is particularly noticeable on complex components with numerous child components and prop drilling.  While profiling, we've identified several instances where components are re-rendering even when their props haven't changed, leading to wasted CPU cycles and a sluggish user experience.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

The problem is most evident when performing the following actions:

1.  [Describe a specific user action that triggers the performance issue, e.g., "filtering a large dataset in a table"].
2.  [Describe another user action if necessary].


**Expected Behavior:**

Components should only re-render when their props or state change.  We expect the application to be responsive and maintain a smooth framerate even with substantial data manipulation.


**Actual Behavior:**

Components are re-rendering unnecessarily, leading to dropped frames and a noticeable lag in the user interface.  The performance profiler shows a significant number of re-renders in unrelated components, suggesting a cascading effect triggered by a single state change.


**Possible Causes (Our Investigation So Far):**

* **Unnecessary state updates:** We suspect some state updates might be triggering re-renders in unintended components. We are currently investigating this possibility.
* **Missing `useMemo` or `React.memo`:**  We are reviewing our codebase to ensure we are appropriately using `useMemo` for expensive computations and `React.memo` for component optimization.
* **Implicit dependencies in functional components:** We are looking for instances of missing dependencies in custom hooks or functional components that might be causing unexpected re-renders.


**Environment:**

* React Version: [Insert React version]
* Browser: [Insert Browser and version]
* Operating System: [Insert OS]


**Screenshots/Videos (Optional):**

[Add screenshots or short video clips demonstrating the performance issue if applicable]


**Proposed Solution (Optional):**

We are currently exploring the following solutions:

* More strategic use of `useCallback`
* Refactoring components to reduce prop drilling
* Implementing a more efficient state management solution if necessary (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai).


We would appreciate any suggestions or guidance on how to effectively debug and resolve these performance issues.  We've attached a performance profile from [tool used, e.g., React DevTools] for your review.  [Attach profile if possible].
