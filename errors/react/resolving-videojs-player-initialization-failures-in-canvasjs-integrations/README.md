# üêû Resolving VideoJS Player Initialization Failures in CanvasJS Integrations


This document addresses a common issue encountered when integrating VideoJS players within a CanvasJS chart visualization. The problem typically manifests as a failure to initialize the VideoJS player, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be, or throwing JavaScript errors related to DOM manipulation or player object instantiation. This usually stems from conflicting JavaScript libraries or improper timing of the player initialization within the CanvasJS rendering lifecycle.

**Description of the Error:**

The most frequent symptoms are:

* A blank space where the VideoJS player should be displayed within the CanvasJS chart's container.
* JavaScript errors in the browser's console related to `videojs` being undefined, or errors referencing methods or properties of a nonexistent VideoJS player object.
* The chart renders correctly but the video player remains unresponsive or fails to load.

**Code for Fixing Step-by-Step:**

This example assumes you're using VideoJS 7 and have it included via a CDN or your build process.  We'll focus on ensuring the VideoJS player initializes *after* the CanvasJS chart has fully rendered.

```javascript
// Include necessary libraries (replace with your actual paths)
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7"></script>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>


//CanvasJS Chart setup:
var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...
});

chart.render();

// VideoJS Player initialization after Chart rendering.  Use a setTimeout to ensure CanvasJS is done.

setTimeout(function() {
  //Create the video player once the chart has finished rendering
    var player = videojs('my-video-player', {
      sources: [{
          src: 'your-video-source.mp4',
          type: 'video/mp4'
      }],
      autoplay: false, //Set autoplay to your desired setting
      controls: true    //Show/hide controls as desired
    });

    //Error handling: check if the player created correctly.
    if (player) {
        console.log("VideoJS Player initialized successfully.");
    } else {
        console.error("VideoJS Player initialization failed. Check the 'my-video-player' element exists and VideoJS is loaded correctly.");
    }


    // Add event listeners if needed (e.g., for player events)
    player.on('ended', function() {
        console.log('Video ended');
    });


    //Dispose of the video player to prevent memory leaks when the component is unmounted or no longer needed.
    // Example within a React component's `componentWillUnmount()` method:
    // componentWillUnmount() {
    //   if (this.player) {
    //      this.player.dispose();
    //      this.player = null;
    //   }
    //}

}, 1000); // Adjust the timeout value (milliseconds) as needed


```

**Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the timing of the VideoJS initialization. If you try to initialize the player before the CanvasJS chart has finished rendering, the `my-video-player` element might not exist in the DOM yet, leading to failure. The `setTimeout` function provides a delay, allowing CanvasJS to complete its rendering before VideoJS attempts to access the DOM element.  The delay value (1000 milliseconds in this case) might need adjustment based on the complexity of your chart and your application's performance. Using the timeout guarantees the VideoJS Player is created only after the chart is rendered fully.

The added error handling checks if the player was created successfully. If the player object is null or undefined, it logs an error message that helps in debugging.
