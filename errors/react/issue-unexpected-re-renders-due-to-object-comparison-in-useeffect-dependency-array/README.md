# 🐞 ## Issue: Unexpected re-renders due to object comparison in useEffect dependency array


**Description:**

We're experiencing excessive re-renders in our component, specifically within a `useEffect` hook.  The problem seems to stem from the way we're managing the dependency array. We're passing an object as a dependency, and React isn't effectively detecting when the object has truly *changed*.  This leads to unnecessary calls to the effect, impacting performance and potentially causing unexpected side effects.


**Example Code:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect called!');
    // Perform some expensive operation with data
  }, [data]); // Problem: Object comparison issue

  const updateData = () => {
    setData({ ...data, age: data.age + 1 }); // Seems like a shallow copy, but still triggers re-render
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {data.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {data.age}</p>
      <button onClick={updateData}>Update Age</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

The `useEffect` hook should only run when the `data` object's properties actually change.  In the example above, clicking the button should update the age, and the effect should run accordingly.  However, even a seemingly shallow copy triggers a re-render, as React's default object comparison is shallow.


**Actual Behavior:**

The `useEffect` hook is triggered even when only a single property within the `data` object changes.  This leads to performance degradation, especially with complex objects or computationally intensive operations within the effect.


**Possible Solutions (or questions):**

* Using `useMemo` to memoize the object and only trigger a re-render when the object reference changes (but this might lead to other issues with stale closures).
* Using a custom equality check function within the `useEffect` dependency array.
* Refactoring the state management to utilize simpler data structures, or using a state management library (Redux, Zustand, Jotai)

We're seeking advice on the best approach to resolve this common issue and optimize our component's performance.  Any suggestions or examples are greatly appreciated.
