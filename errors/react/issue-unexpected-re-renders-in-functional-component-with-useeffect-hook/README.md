# 🐞 ## Issue: Unexpected re-renders in functional component with useEffect hook


**Description:**

I'm experiencing unexpected re-renders in a functional component that uses the `useEffect` hook.  The component fetches data from an API and updates its state accordingly.  However, the component seems to re-render multiple times even when the data hasn't changed. This leads to performance issues and unnecessary API calls.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  if (!data) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display data here */}
      {data.map(item => (
        <p key={item.id}>{item.name}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

The component should fetch data once on mount and only re-render when the `data` state actually changes.

**Actual Behavior:**

The component re-renders multiple times, even though the `data` state remains the same after the initial fetch.  I've inspected the browser's developer tools and can see unnecessary re-renders in the component's lifecycle.

**Possible Causes (My guesses):**

* **Incorrect dependency array:** While I've used an empty array `[]`, I'm unsure if there might be some subtle side effects triggering re-renders.
* **Unnecessary state updates:**  Perhaps there's a hidden state update elsewhere that's causing this.
* **React's internal optimizations:**  Could there be a problem with React's reconciliation process?


**Environment:**

* React version: 18.2.0
* Browser: Chrome 114
* Operating System: macOS Ventura


**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone the repository (link to repo would go here).
2. Run `npm start`.
3. Observe the console for unnecessary re-renders.  (Consider using React DevTools for precise tracking)


**Additional Context:**

I've tried adding `console.log` statements to track state changes and component re-renders, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
