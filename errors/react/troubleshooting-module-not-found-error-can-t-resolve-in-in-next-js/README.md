# 🐞 Troubleshooting "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '...' in ..." in Next.js


This document addresses a common error encountered in Next.js applications:  `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '...' in ...`.  This error typically occurs when Next.js cannot locate a required module during the build or runtime process. This can stem from various causes, including incorrect import paths, missing dependencies, or issues with the `next.config.js` file.


## Description of the Error

The error message itself, `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '...' in ...`, provides some clues.  The "..." represents the missing module and the directory where Next.js is looking for it. For example:

`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-icons/fa' in '/Users/myuser/myproject/components'`

This indicates that Next.js can't find the `react-icons/fa` module within the `/components` directory of your project.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume we are encountering the error `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'my-custom-module' in '/src/pages/index.js'` because we created a custom module.


**1. Verify Module Existence and Location:**

First, ensure that the module (`my-custom-module.js` or `my-custom-module.ts` in this example) actually exists at the expected location.  Double-check the file name, casing, and path. Let's say it's located in `src/utils/my-custom-module.js`.

**2. Correct the Import Path:**

The import statement in `src/pages/index.js` must accurately reflect the module's location.  The incorrect import would look like this:

```javascript
// Incorrect import
import myCustomModule from 'my-custom-module';
```

The corrected import, referencing the correct path, should be:

```javascript
// Correct import
import myCustomModule from '@/utils/my-custom-module'; // Using Next.js alias
```

or

```javascript
// Correct import (without alias)
import myCustomModule from '../utils/my-custom-module';
```

**3.  Ensure the Module is Exported Correctly:**

In `src/utils/my-custom-module.js`, confirm that the module is correctly exported:

```javascript
// my-custom-module.js
export const myCustomFunction = () => {
  console.log('My custom function');
};
```

**4. Install Necessary Dependencies (if applicable):**

If `my-custom-module` relies on external libraries, make sure they are installed:

```bash
npm install <package-name>  // or yarn add <package-name>
```


**5. Next.js `next.config.js` (for advanced cases):**

If you're using custom paths or webpack configurations, you might need to adjust your `next.config.js` file.  For instance, if you're working with a monorepo or have unusual directory structures:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    // ... your webpack configurations ...
    return config;
  },
  // ... other configurations
};
```


## Explanation

The `Module not found` error arises because JavaScript (and Next.js's underlying webpack) needs to resolve the path to the imported module.  If the path is incorrect, the module cannot be located, leading to the error.  Using Next.js aliases (`@`) can significantly improve the maintainability and readability of import paths. Always double check file names, casing, and the existence of necessary dependencies.
