# 🐞 ## Issue: Unexpected Re-renders due to Object Comparison in `useEffect` Hook


**Description:**

React's `useEffect` hook relies on the equality check of dependencies array to determine whether to re-run the effect.  However, when dealing with objects as dependencies, a common pitfall arises leading to unnecessary re-renders.  Even if the object's contents haven't changed, a simple assignment `myObject = {...myObject}` creates a new object reference, triggering the effect.  This can severely impact performance, especially with large objects or frequent updates.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [myObject, setMyObject] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Effect running!'); // Runs more often than expected
    // ... perform some expensive operation based on myObject ...
  }, [myObject]);

  const updateAge = () => {
    setMyObject({ ...myObject, age: myObject.age + 1 }); // Creates a new object reference
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {myObject.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {myObject.age}</p>
      <button onClick={updateAge}>Increment Age</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, even though only the `age` property changes, the `useEffect` hook re-runs because `myObject` is a new object reference after each call to `updateAge`.

**Proposed Solutions:**

* **Use `useMemo` to memoize the object:** This can prevent unnecessary object creation if the object's content hasn't changed.

```javascript
const memoizedObject = useMemo(() => myObject, [myObject]);
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Effect running!');
}, [memoizedObject]);
```

* **Shallow comparison using `useRef`:**  For simpler objects, `useRef` can hold the object's state and enable direct comparison.  This avoids creating new references.

* **Use a library like `immer`:**  `immer` provides a more elegant way to update objects immutably, preventing the creation of new object references.


**Suggested Improvements:**

* Could we improve the React documentation to clearly explain this common issue and provide clear guidance on how to effectively manage object dependencies in `useEffect`?
* Should the React team consider introducing a feature to automatically handle shallow comparisons for object dependencies in `useEffect` (perhaps an optional flag)?


**Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the complexity of the application and the frequency of the unnecessary re-renders).  This can lead to performance degradation and unexpected behaviour.
