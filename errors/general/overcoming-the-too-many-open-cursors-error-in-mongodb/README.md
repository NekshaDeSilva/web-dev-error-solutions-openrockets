# üêû Overcoming the "Too Many Open Cursors" Error in MongoDB


**Description of the Error:**

The "Too Many Open Cursors" error in MongoDB arises when a client application maintains an excessive number of open cursors without closing them properly.  Each cursor represents an open connection to a MongoDB query result set.  If the number of open cursors surpasses the server's configured limit (typically controlled by `wiredTigerCursorCacheSizeMB`), MongoDB will reject further connection attempts or requests, resulting in this error.  This is particularly common in long-running applications that fail to release cursors after data processing.

**Code Example (Illustrative Python with pymongo):**

This example demonstrates incorrect cursor handling, leading to the error:

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# Incorrect cursor handling: cursor is never closed
for document in collection.find({}):
    # Process document
    print(document)

# Client is not closed, potentially keeping other resources open
# ... more code ...
```

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Explicitly Close Cursors:**  The most crucial step is to ensure each cursor is explicitly closed after use.  This releases the server-side resources.

2. **Use `with` Statements (Context Managers):**  Python's `with` statement provides an elegant way to guarantee resource cleanup, even in case of exceptions.

3. **Close the Client Connection:**  Finally, close the `MongoClient` connection when it's no longer needed. This releases all associated resources, including any remaining open cursors.


**Corrected Code:**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

try:
    with collection.find({}) as cursor: # Uses context manager for automatic closure
        for document in cursor:
            # Process document
            print(document)
except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    client.close() # Ensures client is closed even if errors occur

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code utilizes a `with` statement to manage the cursor. The `cursor` object is automatically closed when the `with` block exits, regardless of whether the loop completes successfully or an exception is raised. The `finally` block guarantees that the `client` connection is closed, preventing resource leaks.  This prevents the accumulation of open cursors, thus resolving the "Too Many Open Cursors" error.
