# üêû Overcoming "Too Many Opened Cursors" in MongoDB


This document addresses a common MongoDB problem: the "too many opened cursors" error.  This typically occurs when your application opens many cursors for database queries but fails to close them properly, leading to resource exhaustion on the MongoDB server.


## Description of the Error

The "too many opened cursors" error manifests in different ways depending on your application and driver.  You might see explicit error messages from your MongoDB driver,  performance degradation, or even connection failures.  The underlying issue is that your application has exceeded the maximum number of cursors allowed by the MongoDB server (configurable via `maxConnPoolSize`). This limit is in place to prevent resource starvation.  When exceeded, new queries might fail or be significantly delayed.


## Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step

This example uses the Python driver `pymongo`.  The core principle is to explicitly close cursors after use.

**Step 1: Identify Cursors**

First, locate all parts of your code that interact with MongoDB cursors. This typically involves using methods like `find()` or `aggregate()`.

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# Problematic code - cursor is not closed
cursor = collection.find({"field": "value"})
for document in cursor:
    # Process document
    print(document)

# More problematic code - cursor is not closed in a try/except block
try:
    cursor2 = collection.find({"anotherField": "anotherValue"})
    for doc in cursor2:
        # Process the document
        print(doc)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


client.close() # This only closes the client, not individual cursors.
```

**Step 2: Implement Proper Cursor Closing**

Use a `try...finally` block or a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure the cursor is always closed, even if errors occur.  The `with` statement is generally preferred for its clarity and conciseness.

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

try:
    with collection.find({"field": "value"}) as cursor:
        for document in cursor:
            # Process document
            print(document)

    with collection.find({"anotherField": "anotherValue"}) as cursor2:
      for doc in cursor2:
        # Process document
        print(doc)

except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    client.close()


```

**Step 3:  Iterate Efficiently**

Avoid unnecessarily keeping the entire cursor in memory. If you‚Äôre processing a large dataset, iterate through the cursor in smaller batches using the `limit()` method:

```python
batch_size = 1000
try:
    with collection.find({"field": "value"}).batch_size(batch_size) as cursor:
        for document in cursor:
            # Process document
            print(document)
except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
  client.close()
```

**Step 4:  Check for Memory Leaks**

Use your system's monitoring tools (e.g., `top` on Linux, Task Manager on Windows) or profiling tools to identify if your application is leaking memory.  Memory leaks can indirectly contribute to the "too many opened cursors" error because the application may continue to hold onto references to cursors even after they‚Äôre no longer needed.


## Explanation

The `with` statement ensures that the `cursor.close()` method is called automatically when the block exits, regardless of whether exceptions are raised. This guarantees resource cleanup and prevents the accumulation of open cursors.  Using `batch_size` prevents loading the entire result set into memory at once, improving efficiency for large datasets and reducing memory pressure.
