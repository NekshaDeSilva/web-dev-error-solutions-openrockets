# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Initialization Failure on CanvasJS Chart Interaction


This document addresses a common issue where a VideoJS player fails to initialize or plays erratically when integrated with a CanvasJS chart.  This often occurs because both libraries might be vying for the same DOM elements or conflicting event listeners.  This scenario is particularly problematic if the VideoJS player is embedded within or near the CanvasJS chart's container.


**Description of the Error:**

The VideoJS player might exhibit several symptoms including:

* **No video playback:** The video player displays, but the video fails to load or play.
* **Stuttering or freezing:** The video playback is intermittent and experiences frequent stalls.
* **Error messages in the browser console:**  Errors related to DOM manipulation or event listener conflicts might appear.
* **Unexpected behavior on chart interaction:**  Interacting with the CanvasJS chart (e.g., zooming, panning) disrupts the VideoJS player's functionality.


**Code Example (Illustrative):**

Let's assume a scenario where the VideoJS player is within a div that is adjacent to a CanvasJS chart container. A common mistake is assigning the VideoJS player to the same container or a container that is a parent or child of the CanvasJS container.

**Problem Code:**

```html
<div id="chartContainer"></div>
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="myVideo" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
    data-setup='{}'></video>
</div>

<script>
  // CanvasJS Chart Code (omitted for brevity,  assume chart initialization here)
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
     // chart options...
  });
  chart.render();

  //VideoJS Initialization (incorrect placement)
  videojs('myVideo'); 
</script>
```

**Fixing Step-by-Step:**

1. **Separate Containers:** Ensure the VideoJS player and CanvasJS chart are within distinctly separate and unrelated DOM elements. This minimizes interference.

2. **Delayed VideoJS Initialization:** Delay the initialization of the VideoJS player until after the CanvasJS chart has completely rendered. This prevents conflicts during DOM manipulation.  You can achieve this using `setTimeout` or a promise-based approach.

3. **Event Listener Management:** Carefully examine and manage event listeners.  If necessary, remove or modify event listeners on the chart container to prevent them from interfering with the video player.


**Corrected Code:**

```html
<div id="chartContainer"></div>
<div id="videoContainer">
  <video id="myVideo" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
    data-setup='{}'></video>
</div>

<script>
  // CanvasJS Chart Code (omitted for brevity)
  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
     // chart options...
  });
  chart.render();

  //VideoJS Initialization (delayed and improved)
  setTimeout(function() {
    var myPlayer = videojs('myVideo');
    // Add event listeners to the video player here if needed, managing potential conflicts.
  }, 1000); //Adjust delay as needed. 
</script>
```


**Explanation:**

The corrected code separates the containers, ensuring that both libraries operate in independent spaces.  The `setTimeout` function delays the VideoJS player initialization by 1 second. This ensures that the CanvasJS chart's rendering is complete before the VideoJS player attempts to initialize, thus avoiding conflicts. Adjust the timeout value as needed, based on your chart's rendering time. You could also improve this using a promise to ensure chart rendering completes before running videojs.
