# üêû Fixing VideoJS Player Buffering Issues on Low Bandwidth Connections


## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using VideoJS is persistent buffering, especially on connections with low bandwidth.  This manifests as frequent pauses in playback, a spinning buffering icon, and an overall frustrating viewing experience.  The issue often stems from the player's default behavior of requesting unnecessarily large chunks of video data, overwhelming the network connection.

## Code Fix Step-by-Step

This solution focuses on optimizing the player's buffering strategy using VideoJS's configuration options. We'll modify the player's `options` to control buffer size and related settings.

**Step 1: Include VideoJS**

Make sure you have included the VideoJS library in your HTML file.  If you haven't already, download it from the official website and include it via a `<script>` tag.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.js"></script>
```

**Step 2:  Initialize VideoJS with Optimized Options**

This is where the crucial changes occur. We'll adjust `bufferSize`, `playbackRate`, and potentially `preload` for improved performance on low-bandwidth connections.

```html
<video id="my-video" class="video-js" controls preload="auto" poster="poster.jpg" data-setup='{ "playbackRates": [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2], "sources": [{ "src": "myvideo.mp4", "type": "video/mp4" }], "controlBar": { "children": { "playToggle": {}, "volumePanel": {}, "progressControl": {}, "currentTimeDisplay": {}, "timeDivider": {}, "durationDisplay": {} } }, "techOrder":["html5"] }'>
</video>

<script>
  var player = videojs('my-video');

  //Adjust Buffering Settings
  player.ready(function(){
    this.bufferedPercent(); //check buffered percentage
    this.options_.playbackRates = [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]; //Allow user to change playback speeds
    this.options_.preload = "auto"; //adjust auto-preload to "metadata" for only loading metadata and no video data
    this.options_.bufferSize = 3; // Adjust buffer size (in seconds). Lower values reduce buffering time but may lead to more frequent pauses, depending on your connection and content.Experiment with values. Experiment to find the optimal balance.
    //Setting a smaller buffer size generally leads to less buffering time at the cost of more frequent pauses. 
  });

</script>
```

**Step 3:  HTML5 Tech Order**

Prioritize the HTML5 tech in the `techOrder` to leverage the browser's native video player capabilities which often handle low bandwidth situations better.


## Explanation

The core of this fix lies in reducing the `bufferSize`.  By default, VideoJS might buffer a large amount of video data upfront, which is inefficient on low-bandwidth connections.  Lowering this value forces the player to request smaller chunks more frequently, leading to faster initial playback and reduced buffering pauses.  The `playbackRates` helps users reduce data usage by allowing to play back at lower speeds. Changing `preload` to "metadata" only downloads metadata of video file.


Experimentation is key. You might need to fine-tune the `bufferSize` value based on your specific video content and target bandwidth. Start with a small value (e.g., 2 or 3 seconds) and gradually increase it if you experience too many interruptions.  The `playbackRates` option gives users more control over the playback speed allowing them to mitigate slow playback issues by reducing the playback speed.
