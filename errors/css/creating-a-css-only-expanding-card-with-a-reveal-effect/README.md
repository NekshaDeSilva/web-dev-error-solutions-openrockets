# üêû Creating a CSS-only Expanding Card with a Reveal Effect


This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands vertically to reveal hidden content when hovered over, providing a clean and engaging user experience. This example utilizes standard CSS3 properties, making it widely compatible and easy to understand.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card uses a simple structure with a container div holding the visible header and hidden content.  The key to the effect is utilizing CSS transitions on `height` and `max-height` properties, along with a clever use of `overflow: hidden` to initially conceal the content.  On hover, the `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand, smoothly animated by the transition.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out; /* Smooth transition */
  max-height: 100px; /* Initially collapsed */
}

.card:hover {
  max-height: 300px; /* Expand on hover */
}

.card-header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header">
    <h3>Click Me!</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>This is some hidden content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.</p>
    <p>You can add as much content as you like here.  The card will smoothly expand to accommodate it.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container. `overflow: hidden` is crucial for hiding the content initially.  The `transition` property defines a smooth animation for the `max-height` change. `max-height` is set to a small value initially.
* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `max-height` is increased, triggering the animation.  Adjust this value to control the final expanded height.
* **`.card-header` and `.card-content`:**  These classes simply style the header and content sections for better visual presentation.
