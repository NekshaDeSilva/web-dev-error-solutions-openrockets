# üêû Creating a CSS-Only Expanding Card


This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly animate the card's height and content when hovered over.  We'll utilize standard CSS, avoiding any pre-processors like Sass or Less, or frameworks like Tailwind CSS, for maximum clarity and broad applicability.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card starts with a minimal height, just enough to display a title. On hover, the height expands to reveal hidden content.  This expansion is achieved smoothly using CSS transitions.  A subtle shadow is added to enhance the three-dimensional effect.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows on initial state */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  height: 80px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 200px; /* Height on hover */
}

.card-title {
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">Expanding Card</div>
  <div class="card-content">
    This is the content of the expanding card.  You can add as much text or other elements as you need. This effect is purely CSS-based, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card element.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial; it prevents the content from spilling outside the card before it expands. The `transition` property defines the animation for the height change.
* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `height` property is increased to reveal the hidden content.
* **`.card-title` and `.card-content`:** These classes style the title and content sections of the card, respectively.
