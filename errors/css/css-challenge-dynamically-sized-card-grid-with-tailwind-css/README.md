# üêû CSS Challenge:  Dynamically Sized Card Grid with Tailwind CSS


This challenge involves creating a responsive card grid using Tailwind CSS. The grid should dynamically adjust the number of columns based on the screen size, ensuring cards always maintain a consistent aspect ratio and spacing.  We'll aim for a clean, modern aesthetic.

## Description of the Styling:

The design will use Tailwind's responsive utility classes to create a grid of cards.  The cards will have a consistent aspect ratio (e.g., 2:1), maintaining their proportions across different screen sizes.  We'll utilize Tailwind's spacing and border utilities for visual appeal and consistency. The cards themselves will have a simple, clean design with a subtle background color and dark text. The layout will adapt smoothly from a single column on smaller screens to multiple columns on larger screens.

## Explanation:

* **`container mx-auto px-4 py-8`**: This centers the content horizontally and adds padding.
* **`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`**: This creates the responsive grid.  `grid-cols-1` sets a single column by default.  The `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` prefixes apply the specified number of columns at different screen sizes (using Tailwind's breakpoint system). `gap-4` adds spacing between the cards.
* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`**: These classes style each card with a white background, rounded corners, a shadow, and padding.
* **`text-xl font-semibold mb-2`**: Styles the card title.
* **`text-gray-700`**: Styles the card text.

Remember to include the Tailwind CSS CDN link in your `<head>` to use these classes.  You can easily add or remove cards by duplicating the card div elements.
