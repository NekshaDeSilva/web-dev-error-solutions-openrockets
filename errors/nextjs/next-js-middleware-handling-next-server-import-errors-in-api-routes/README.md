# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `next/server` Import Errors in API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when attempting to use Next.js's `next/server` API within API routes.  The error typically manifests as a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` or a similar message indicating that the `next/server` module is inaccessible within the context of an API route file.  This happens because API routes, by default, are executed in a Node.js environment which doesn't support the ES modules syntax (`import`/`export`) used by `next/server`.


**Description of the Error:**

The core issue is attempting to use functionalities from `next/server` (designed for middleware and edge functions) within a traditional API route.  `next/server` relies on the Edge Runtime environment for features like `NextResponse`, which isn't available in the serverless environment used by API routes.


**Code Example (Incorrect):**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js (Incorrect - will throw an error)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const response = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from API Route!' });
  // ... Error here because NextResponse is not available.
  res.status(200).json(response) 
}
```

**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**

Instead of `next/server`, API routes should utilize the standard Node.js `http` or `https` modules for creating responses.


**Code Example (Corrected):**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js (Corrected)
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const data = { message: 'Hello from API Route!' };
  res.status(200).json(data); 
}
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code leverages the built-in `res` object provided by the API route's request handler.  The `res.status()` method sets the HTTP status code, and `res.json()` directly sends a JSON response.  This approach is compatible with the serverless Node.js environment of API routes.  Importantly, there is no need for `next/server` here.

**Important Note:** If you need edge-side functionalities (like manipulating headers before the response reaches the client), you should use Next.js Middleware instead of API routes.
