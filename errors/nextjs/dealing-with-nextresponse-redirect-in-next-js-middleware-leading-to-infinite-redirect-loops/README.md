# 🐞 Dealing with `NextResponse.redirect()` in Next.js Middleware leading to infinite redirect loops


This document addresses a common issue encountered when using `NextResponse.redirect()` within Next.js Middleware:  unintentional infinite redirect loops.  This happens when the redirect condition isn't properly managed, causing the middleware to repeatedly redirect the request, resulting in a browser error.

**Description of the Error:**

When using `NextResponse.redirect()` in middleware, if the condition triggering the redirect is always true (or perpetually becomes true due to a bug), the middleware will redirect the request again and again.  The browser will detect this as an infinite loop and will typically display an error message indicating a "too many redirects" or similar problem.  This can be especially frustrating to debug because the error isn't always clear from the middleware's logs.


**Example Scenario and Code (Problem):**

Let's say we want to redirect all requests to `/login` unless the user is authenticated.  The following middleware implementation contains a flaw that leads to an infinite redirect loop:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = false; // Simulating unauthenticated user. Replace with actual auth logic.

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

In this faulty code, `isAuthenticated` is always `false`. Therefore, every request triggers a redirect to `/login`.  Because `/login` (presumably) also runs this middleware, it results in an endless redirect chain.

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Correct Authentication Check:** The most important step is ensuring that your authentication check (`isAuthenticated`) is accurate and reliable. This usually involves accessing session data, cookies, or JWTs.  Replace the placeholder `isAuthenticated = false;` with your actual authentication mechanism.  For example, using a cookie:

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token'); // Get token from cookie

  const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0; //Simple check, refine as needed.

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

2. **Avoid Redirecting from the Login Page:**  The crucial step is preventing the middleware from re-redirecting when the request originates from the login page itself. We'll add a check for that.

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');
  const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0;

  const currentPath = new URL(req.url).pathname;

  if (!isAuthenticated && currentPath !== '/login') { //only redirect if not on /login
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

3. **Consider using `rewrite` instead of `redirect` (optional):**  If the goal is to simply handle the routing internally rather than visibly redirect the user, consider using `NextResponse.rewrite()` instead.  This will change the URL internally without updating the browser's URL bar.  This approach depends on the logic you are implementing.

```javascript
//Using rewrite instead of redirect.  Only use this if it suits your logic.

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
    const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');
    const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0;
    const currentPath = new URL(req.url).pathname;

    if (!isAuthenticated && currentPath !== '/login') {
        return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url));
    }
}
export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

**Explanation:**

The key to avoiding infinite redirects is to break the cycle. By ensuring that the middleware only redirects when the user is *not* authenticated and the request is *not* already directed at the login page, the loop is prevented.
