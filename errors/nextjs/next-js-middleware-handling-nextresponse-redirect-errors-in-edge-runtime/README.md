# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `NextResponse.redirect()` Errors in Edge Runtime


This document addresses a common error developers encounter when using `NextResponse.redirect()` within Next.js Middleware running in the Edge runtime.  The error typically manifests as a 500 Internal Server Error or unexpected behavior, often stemming from incorrect usage of the `NextResponse` object or incompatible redirects.

**Description of the Error:**

When using `NextResponse.redirect()` in middleware targeting the Edge runtime (e.g., `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js`), developers might face issues like:

* **500 Internal Server Error:**  The server fails to properly process the redirect.
* **Incorrect redirect URL:** The redirect destination is not as intended, potentially leading to a 404 or other client-side errors.
* **Infinite redirect loops:**  The middleware continuously redirects, resulting in a browser error.

This often arises from improper handling of external URLs, relative paths, or missing `NextResponse` configuration.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume a scenario where we want to redirect all requests to `/login` unless the user is already authenticated.  The following example demonstrates both an incorrect and a correct implementation:

**Incorrect Implementation (Leads to Errors):**

```javascript
// middleware.js (INCORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/login'); // Potential issue here!
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

**Correct Implementation:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (CORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');

  if (!token) {
    const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Using rewrite for internal redirects.
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

**Explanation:**

The incorrect implementation directly uses `NextResponse.redirect('/login')`. While this might work in some scenarios (and might even work with the Server runtime), it can cause issues in the Edge runtime.  The `redirect()` method expects a fully qualified URL, not just a relative path.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and 500 errors, especially in complex deployment setups.

The correct implementation uses `NextResponse.rewrite(url)`. This is the recommended approach for internal redirects within your Next.js application in the Edge runtime. It correctly handles relative paths and ensures the redirect works reliably.  We clone the request's URL and update only the `pathname`.

**Note:** For external redirects (redirecting to a different domain), `NextResponse.redirect` is appropriate, but you must provide a fully qualified URL:

```javascript
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('https://example.com'));
```
