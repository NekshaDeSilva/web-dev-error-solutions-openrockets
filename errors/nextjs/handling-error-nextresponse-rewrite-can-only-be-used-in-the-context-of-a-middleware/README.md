# üêû Handling `Error: NextResponse.rewrite() can only be used in the context of a middleware`


This document describes a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: `Error: NextResponse.rewrite() can only be used in the context of a middleware`. This error arises when developers attempt to use `NextResponse.rewrite()` outside of a middleware function.  `NextResponse.rewrite()` is specifically designed to redirect requests within the middleware phase of Next.js's request handling.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message clearly indicates that the `NextResponse.rewrite()` method is only functional within the scope of a middleware function defined using `middleware.js` or in a file within the `middleware` directory. Attempting to use it in an API route, page component, or other parts of the application will result in this error.


**Full Code of Fixing Step-by-Step:**

Let's say we have an incorrect implementation attempting to redirect based on a user's authentication status in a page component:

**Incorrect Implementation (pages/profile.js):**

```javascript
// pages/profile.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default function Profile() {
  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your authentication logic

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', location.origin)) />; // Incorrect usage
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Profile Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This will throw the error.  The correct approach involves using middleware:


**Correct Implementation (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your actual authentication logic (e.g., using cookies, session storage)

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/profile', // Only apply middleware to /profile route
}
```

**Explanation:**

This corrected code moves the redirection logic into a middleware function.  The `matcher` property in the `config` object specifies that this middleware should only run for requests to the `/profile` route. Now, before the `/profile` page is rendered, the middleware checks authentication. If the user is not authenticated, it rewrites the request to `/login`.

**Summary:**

The key takeaway is that `NextResponse.rewrite()` must be used within a Next.js middleware function. Using it elsewhere will lead to the `Error: NextResponse.rewrite() can only be used in the context of a middleware` error.  Middleware provides a powerful mechanism for handling requests before they reach your pages or API routes, allowing for centralized logic like authentication and redirection.
