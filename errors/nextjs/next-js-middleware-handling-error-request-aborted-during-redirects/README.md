# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Error: Request aborted` during redirects


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware:  `Error: Request aborted`. This typically occurs when attempting a redirect within middleware, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or long-running processes that exceed the middleware's execution time limit.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: Request aborted` error in Next.js Middleware means the request processing was prematurely terminated.  This often happens because middleware has a short execution time limit.  If your redirect logic involves fetching data from an external API or performing complex computations, the request might be aborted before the redirect can be completed. This frequently manifests when a redirect is attempted within an `async` function that takes longer than expected to resolve.


**Code Example (Problematic):**

```javascript
// pages/api/route.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function middleware(req) {
  const response = await fetch('https://slow-api.com/data'); //Simulates a slow API call
  const data = await response.json();

  if (data.status === 'error') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/error', req.url));
  } else {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/success', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/protected' // Matcher
}
```

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Use `NextResponse.rewrite` instead of `NextResponse.redirect` for internal redirects:**  If you're redirecting within your own application (e.g., from `/protected` to `/success`),  `rewrite` is generally preferred for performance reasons. It doesn't trigger a full HTTP redirect, leading to faster user experience.

2. **Handle potential errors gracefully:** Wrap your asynchronous operations in a `try...catch` block to catch potential errors that might interrupt the redirect process.

3. **Optimize API calls (if applicable):** If fetching data from an external API, consider optimizing your API calls to minimize latency.  This might involve caching, using more efficient endpoints, or reducing the amount of data fetched.

4. **Consider using a dedicated function for asynchronous operations:** Move your asynchronous logic into a separate function, ensuring that the middleware function itself remains concise and fast.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/route.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://slow-api.com/data', {timeout: 5000}); // Added timeout 
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
        return {status: 'error'};
    }
}

export async function middleware(req) {
  const data = await fetchData();

  if (data.status === 'error') {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/error', req.url)); // Using rewrite for internal redirects
  } else {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/success', req.url)); // Using rewrite for internal redirects
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/protected'
}
```


**Explanation:**

The corrected code addresses the `Error: Request aborted` by:

* **Using `NextResponse.rewrite`:**  Improves performance for internal redirects.
* **Adding error handling:** The `try...catch` block prevents unhandled errors from prematurely ending the middleware execution.
* **Separating asynchronous operations:**  The `fetchData` function isolates the asynchronous operation, making the middleware code cleaner and easier to manage.
* **Adding a timeout:** The fetch options include a timeout to prevent indefinite hanging, which is critical for slow APIs.
