# üêû Troubleshooting Next.js Middleware:  `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')`


This document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with Next.js Middleware, specifically when accessing properties from the `request` object before they've been properly populated. This often manifests when trying to access localization data (like `locale`) within the middleware function before the relevant headers are fully processed.


## Description of the Error

The error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')` indicates that you're attempting to access the `locale` property of the `request` object within your middleware, but this property is `undefined`.  This usually occurs because the middleware function is executed before Next.js has had a chance to parse and set the request headers containing the locale information.


## Code Example: Problematic Middleware

This code attempts to redirect based on locale *before* the locale is available:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale; // Error occurs here!

  if (locale === 'es') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

## Step-by-Step Fix


1. **Ensure Locale Parsing:** Confirm that your Next.js application is correctly configured to parse locales. Check your `next.config.js` file for the `i18n` configuration.  Without this, the locale will never be available.

```javascript
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'es'],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

2. **Asynchronous Middleware:** The problem arises because the request headers are not immediately available.  Rewrite your middleware to use an async function and `await` the request headers processing implicitly by using `req.nextUrl.locale`.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) {
  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale; // Now it should work

  if (locale === 'es') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

3. **Conditional Logic (Alternative):** If you need to perform actions based on the locale *only* for specific routes or conditions, you can add conditional logic after explicitly checking if `locale` is defined:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) {
  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale;

  if (locale && locale === 'es') { //Check for undefined
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

## Explanation

The original code attempts to access `req.nextUrl.locale` synchronously.  However, Next.js's internal processing of the request, including parsing locale information from headers, happens asynchronously. By using `async/await`, we ensure that the middleware waits for the `req.nextUrl.locale` property to be populated before accessing it, resolving the error.  The conditional check in the alternative method provides robustness against the edge case where the locale is not found.
