# üêû Dealing with `TypeError: next.json.rewrite is not a function` in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: `TypeError: next.json.rewrite is not a function`. This error typically arises when attempting to use the `rewrite` method within middleware incorrectly, often due to misunderstanding its usage within the context of the `next` object.  The `rewrite` method is specifically designed for manipulating the incoming request's path and is not available in all middleware contexts or configurations.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message `TypeError: next.json.rewrite is not a function` indicates that you're trying to call the `rewrite` method on a `next` object that doesn't have this functionality. This commonly occurs when:

1. **Incorrect Middleware placement:** The middleware is defined in an incorrect location or isn't properly configured within the `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js` file.
2. **Incorrect `next` object usage:** The `next` object you're using within the middleware doesn't offer the `rewrite` functionality.
3. **Incompatible Next.js Version:**  Older versions of Next.js may not support the `rewrite` method in middleware as expected.

**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's assume we want to rewrite requests to `/old-path` to `/new-path`.  The incorrect implementation might look like this:


```javascript
// middleware.js (INCORRECT)
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-path') {
    next.json.rewrite('/new-path'); // Incorrect usage!
  }
}
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-path'],
}
```

This will result in the error. The correct implementation utilizes the `next.rewrite` function within the `nextResponse` object:

```javascript
// middleware.js (CORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-path') {
    const res = NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/new-path', req.url));
    return res;
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-path'],
};
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code uses `NextResponse.rewrite()`. This correctly redirects the request to the new path.  The key difference is using `NextResponse` to create a response object and then using the `rewrite` method on that response object, rather than directly on the `next` object.  The `new URL('/new-path', req.url)` constructs a new URL object, ensuring the rewrite maintains any query parameters or other URL components from the original request.

* **NextResponse API:**  [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) (Check for the latest version as documentation changes)


**Important Considerations:**

* **Matcher:** The `matcher` property in `config` is crucial. It defines which routes the middleware applies to.  Incorrectly configured matchers can lead to unexpected behavior or the error described above.
* **Next.js Version:** Ensure you're using a version of Next.js that fully supports the `NextResponse` object and its methods. Check the Next.js release notes for any changes related to middleware.
