# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Redirect` Issues After Server-Side Rendering (SSR)


## Description of the Error

A common issue when using Next.js Middleware is unexpected redirect behavior, especially after Server-Side Rendering (SSR).  You might find your application redirects correctly on the initial request, but subsequent client-side navigation or interactions lead to incorrect or unexpected redirects. This often stems from the middleware attempting to redirect after the page has already been rendered on the server.  The client then receives the redirect instruction, leading to a jarring redirect loop or a broken user experience.  This is different from a simple redirect needed to handle authentication; it's about the middleware's interaction with the SSR process itself.


## Full Code of Fixing Step by Step

Let's assume you have a middleware function that redirects users to `/login` if they're not authenticated, but this redirect causes problems after SSR:


**Problem Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')?.value;

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

**Solution (middleware.js):**

The key is to leverage the `NextResponse.rewrite()` method instead of `NextResponse.redirect()` within your middleware when dealing with situations where you need to control the route *after* SSR. `redirect` instructs the client browser to change URL and fetch a new page, while `rewrite` rewrites the internal request before the page is rendered server-side, preventing issues post-SSR.

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')?.value;

  if (!token) {
    // Changed from redirect to rewrite
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

We replaced `NextResponse.redirect()` with `NextResponse.rewrite()`. This crucial change ensures that the redirection happens *before* the page is rendered on the server, eliminating the client-side redirect conflict post-SSR.  The URL still changes in the browser address bar, but the process remains seamless.


## Explanation

The core difference between `redirect` and `rewrite` within Next.js Middleware lies in their timing and effect:

* **`redirect()`:** Tells the client browser to make a new request to a different URL.  This happens *after* the server-side rendering is complete. This is ideal for true redirects (e.g., 302 redirects for authentication).
* **`rewrite()`:** Internally rewrites the request URL *before* the server-side rendering occurs. This means the page is rendered at the new URL from the start, resolving conflicts with post-SSR redirects. This is best for situations where a URL needs manipulation before rendering.


In the context of authentication, using `rewrite` prevents the jarring redirect after a page is already rendered. The user receives the login page directly from the server without a subsequent redirect.
