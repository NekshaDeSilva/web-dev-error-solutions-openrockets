# üêû Debugging "ReferenceError: process is not defined" in Next.js API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when developing serverless functions (API routes) within a Next.js application: `ReferenceError: process is not defined`.  This error arises because the `process` global object, commonly used in Node.js for environment variables and other system-related information, is *not* available within the serverless function execution environment provided by Vercel or other hosting platforms.

**Description of the Error:**

The `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error occurs when your Next.js API route attempts to access the `process` object, which is typically available in Node.js environments but isn't directly accessible within the serverless environment. This often happens when using libraries or code snippets that rely on `process.env` to access environment variables or other `process` properties.

**Code Example (Problematic):**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; // Error occurs here!

  if (apiKey) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'API Key Found' });
  } else {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'API Key Not Found' });
  }
}
```

**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**

1. **Identify the offending code:** Locate the lines of code that are causing the error.  In the example above, it's the line `const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;`.

2. **Use `next/server`'s `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` (for pages):** If you're trying to access environment variables within a page component, `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` are the correct approach. These functions execute on the server and have access to the `process` object.  

    ```javascript
    // pages/my-page.js
    export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
      const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
      return { props: { apiKey } };
    }
    
    export default function MyPage({ apiKey }) {
        //Use apiKey here
        return (
          <div>
              <h1>My Page</h1>
              <p>API Key: {apiKey}</p>
          </div>
        )
    }
    ```


3. **Use `next/config` for API routes:** If you're within an API route, you should avoid direct access to `process.env`. Instead, use the `next/config` module. This module provides a safe way to access environment variables in both client and server contexts.

    ```javascript
    // pages/api/hello.js
    import { unstable_getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"; //if using next-auth
    import config from 'next/config'
    const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = config()


    export default async function handler(req, res) {
      const apiKey = serverRuntimeConfig.API_KEY; // Access the API key from serverRuntimeConfig

      if (apiKey) {
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'API Key Found' });
      } else {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'API Key Not Found' });
      }
    }

    ```

4. **Define Environment Variables:** Make sure your API keys and other environment variables are correctly defined in your `.env.local` file (or the appropriate environment file for your deployment).  **Never commit `.env.*` files to your version control system.**

    ```
    # .env.local
    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
    ```

**Explanation:**

The `process` object is a Node.js global, meaning it's automatically available in Node.js environments. However, Next.js API routes run within a serverless environment, which doesn't automatically provide the `process` object in the same way.  Using `next/config` ensures that environment variables are properly handled, regardless of the context (server-side or client-side rendering).  This is crucial for security and maintainability of your application.
