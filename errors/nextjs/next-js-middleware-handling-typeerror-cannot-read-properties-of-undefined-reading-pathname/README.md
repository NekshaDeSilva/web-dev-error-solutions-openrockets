# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`


This document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with Next.js Middleware, specifically the error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`. This error typically arises when accessing the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property within middleware before it's properly defined.  This often happens due to incorrect usage or timing of accessing request properties.

## Description of the Error

The error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` indicates that the `req.nextUrl` object, or more specifically its `pathname` property, is undefined when your middleware attempts to access it.  This usually means the middleware is trying to read the request URL before Next.js has fully processed it.  This is especially prevalent when using middleware with edge functions.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume you have middleware attempting to redirect based on the pathname:

**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-page') {
    res.redirect('/new-page');
  }
}
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-page'],
};
```

This code will likely throw the error because `req.nextUrl` might not be populated when the middleware function begins execution.


**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Create a copy to avoid modifying the original

  if (url.pathname === '/old-page') {
    url.pathname = '/new-page';
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-page'],
};
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Import `NextResponse`:** We import `NextResponse` from `next/server` to use the `rewrite` method.  This is the preferred method for redirects within middleware.  Directly using `res.redirect` is less reliable and can lead to issues in the context of edge functions.

2. **Clone `req.nextUrl`:** We create a clone of `req.nextUrl` using `.clone()`. This is crucial because directly manipulating `req.nextUrl` can lead to unexpected behavior. The clone ensures that we're working on a copy and not altering the original request object.

3. **Use `NextResponse.rewrite()`:** Instead of `res.redirect`, we now use `NextResponse.rewrite(url)`. This correctly handles the redirection within the middleware context, ensuring compatibility and preventing the error.

## Explanation

The original code failed because it attempted to access `req.nextUrl.pathname` prematurely.  Next.js middleware runs early in the request lifecycle, and the `req` object may not yet contain the fully parsed URL information at the point of execution. By using `NextResponse.rewrite()` and cloning the URL object, we ensure we are working with the finalized URL and performing the redirection correctly, preventing the error.
