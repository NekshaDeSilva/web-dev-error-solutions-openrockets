# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`


This document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with Next.js Middleware, specifically the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`. This typically occurs when attempting to access the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property before it's properly defined within the middleware function.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` signifies that the `req.nextUrl` object, and consequently its `pathname` property, is undefined at the point where your middleware attempts to access it. This often happens because the middleware is triggered before the `nextUrl` object is fully populated with request information.

**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume you have a middleware function that attempts to redirect users based on the pathname:

**Incorrect Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname; // Error occurs here!

  if (pathname === '/dashboard') {
    //Check if user is authenticated, etc.  For now we just redirect for demonstration.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard'],
};
```

**Corrected Code:**

To resolve this, ensure that you access `req.nextUrl` *after* Next.js has fully populated it. This is typically done within an async function to allow for asynchronous operations:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Clone the URL to avoid modifying the original
  const pathname = url.pathname;

  if (pathname === '/dashboard') {
    //Check if user is authenticated, etc. For now we just redirect for demonstration.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url))
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); //Important!  If you don't return NextResponse.next(), the request won't continue.
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard'],
};
```

**Explanation:**

The key change is the use of `req.nextUrl.clone()`.  The `req.nextUrl` object is read-only. Creating a clone allows you to safely manipulate the URL object without impacting the original request.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior or further errors.  Also, the inclusion of `return NextResponse.next();` is critical; this allows the request to proceed to the next stage in the request pipeline.  Without it, the request might be stalled or return an error.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Remember that middleware runs before many aspects of the request are complete.  Use `async/await` for any operations that might take time, such as database queries or external API calls.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling within your middleware to catch unexpected issues and prevent the application from crashing.
* **`matcher` Configuration:** Carefully define your `matcher` to apply middleware only to the necessary routes.
