# üêû Debugging "Error: Route is not found" in Next.js API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js API routes: the `Error: Route is not found` error.  This typically occurs when Next.js cannot locate the requested API route.  This can stem from various issues, including incorrect file naming, path mismatches, or configuration problems.


**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: Route is not found` error in Next.js API routes manifests as a 404 error in the browser's developer console or in your application logs.  It indicates that the client's request to a specific API endpoint failed because Next.js couldn't find the corresponding API route handler file.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you're building an API route to fetch data from a database. You might create a file named `pages/api/data.js`, expecting it to handle requests to `/api/data`. However, if you misspell the filename (e.g., `pages/api/datas.js`) or place it in the wrong directory, you will encounter this error.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume you're trying to create an API route at `/api/hello` that returns a JSON response.

**Incorrect Code (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.ts  (Incorrect filename: should be hello.js)
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from API Route!' });
}
```

**Correct Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from API Route!' });
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **File Extension:** The original example used `.ts` (TypeScript).  Next.js API routes generally work best with `.js` files unless you have specifically configured TypeScript support.  While TypeScript is possible, sticking to `.js` for simplicity often avoids unexpected issues.


2. **File Path:** The `pages/api` directory is crucial.  All API routes must reside within this directory.  Any deviations will result in a 404.


**Verification:**

After making the correction, restart your Next.js development server.  Access the API route in your browser (or using a tool like Postman) via:  `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. You should now receive the JSON response: `{"message": "Hello from API Route!"}`.

**Further Troubleshooting Tips:**

* **Check your `next.config.js`:** Ensure you haven't made any configurations that might interfere with API routes.
* **Inspect Network Tab:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see the exact request and response details.  This helps pinpoint the source of the problem.
* **Use a REST client:** Tools like Postman provide more detailed error messages than a simple browser request.
