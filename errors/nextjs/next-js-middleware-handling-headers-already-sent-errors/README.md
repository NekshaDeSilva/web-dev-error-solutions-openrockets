# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Errors


## Description of the Error

The dreaded "headers already sent" error in Next.js Middleware is a common frustration.  It occurs when your middleware attempts to set headers after the response has already begun to be sent to the client. This typically happens due to unintended output (e.g., accidental console logs, extra whitespace) *before* the `next()` function is called within your middleware.  This prevents the middleware from correctly modifying the response headers and can lead to unexpected behavior or a broken application.

## Code Example & Step-by-step Fix

Let's imagine you're trying to redirect users to a login page if they're not authenticated.  Here's an example of middleware code that *would* produce the "headers already sent" error, followed by the corrected version:

**Problem Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js - INCORRECT
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  console.log('Middleware running...'); // Accidental output!
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'],
};
```

The `console.log` statement is the culprit.  It outputs text *before* the `NextResponse.redirect` or `NextResponse.next()` is called, leading to the error.

**Corrected Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js - CORRECTED
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'],
};
```

Simply removing the `console.log` statement resolves the issue. The order of operations is crucial.  The response headers must be set *before* any output is sent.

## Explanation

Next.js Middleware operates within a very specific context.  It intercepts requests *before* the main application logic executes.  Once the middleware sends a response (explicitly or implicitly via output), it cannot modify the headers further.  This is a fundamental HTTP constraint.  Any data sent to the client *before* the appropriate response headers are set will trigger the "headers already sent" error.  Common culprits, besides accidental `console.log` calls, include:

* **Whitespace or extra newline characters** at the beginning or end of your middleware file.
* **Unhandled errors** that may produce unintended output.
* **Using `console.log`, `console.error`, etc.** within the middleware before the `next()` or `redirect()` call.
* **Including HTML or other content directly in the middleware** outside of the response object.
