# üêû Next.js Middleware: Preventing Infinite Redirects


This document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: unintended infinite redirect loops.  This occurs when your middleware redirects the user repeatedly without a proper exit condition.

## Description of the Error

The error itself might not manifest as a clear error message in your console.  Instead, you'll experience your browser continuously refreshing, often with a spinning loading indicator.  The browser might eventually time out, or you might observe network requests continuously failing or redirecting. This happens because the middleware constantly triggers a new redirect, never allowing the request to reach a stable endpoint or render a page.

## Code Example: Problem and Solution

Let's say you're trying to redirect all requests to `/login` unless the user is authenticated.  The following flawed middleware implementation will cause an infinite redirect loop:


**Problematic Middleware (middleware.js):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}
```

This code checks for a token. If the token is absent, it redirects to `/login`. However, the `/login` page itself might also be protected by this middleware. If the user is *not* logged in, and `GET /login` also lacks a token it will redirect again to `/login` and so on, leading to an infinite loop.

**Solution (middleware.js):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Create a copy of the URL

  if (!token && url.pathname !== '/login') {
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }
}
```

This improved version checks the pathname of the URL *before* redirecting.  If the request is already for `/login`, the middleware does nothing and lets the request proceed. This breaks the redirect loop.


**Explanation:**

The key change is using `req.nextUrl.clone()` and explicitly checking `url.pathname !== '/login'` condition before redirecting. This prevents the middleware from recursively redirecting requests to `/login` again and again.  Creating a clone is crucial; modifying `req.nextUrl` directly can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Summary

Infinite redirects in Next.js Middleware are a common issue stemming from improperly designed redirect logic within the middleware function.  Always ensure you have a proper exit condition (such as a check on the requested URL) to prevent this type of error. By carefully considering the redirection logic and using the `req.nextUrl.clone()` method, you can ensure that your middleware functions correctly.
