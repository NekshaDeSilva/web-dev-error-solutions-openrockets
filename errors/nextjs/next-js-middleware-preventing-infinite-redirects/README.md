# üêû Next.js Middleware: Preventing Infinite Redirects


This document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: **infinite redirect loops**.  This occurs when your middleware repeatedly redirects the user, creating a never-ending cycle.  This often happens due to improperly structured conditional logic or a lack of proper termination conditions.

## Description of the Error

The browser continuously redirects, leading to a "too many redirects" error in the browser console.  The user is unable to access the intended page.  This manifests as a blank page or a continuous spinning loading indicator.  The server logs might show repeated redirect attempts.

## Code Example: Problem & Solution

**Problematic Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();

  // Incorrect Logic - Always redirects
  url.pathname = '/login';
  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
};
```

This middleware *always* redirects to `/login`, regardless of the user's authentication status. This creates an infinite loop if `/login` also uses this middleware, or if the login process itself redirects in a way that again triggers the middleware.


**Step-by-step Fix:**

1. **Introduce Conditional Logic:** The middleware should only redirect if a specific condition isn't met (e.g., user is not logged in).

2. **Check for Authentication:** We'll use a simplified example; replace this with your actual authentication method.

3. **Avoid unnecessary redirects:**  Only redirect if a condition is true, otherwise return a normal response.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  const isLoggedIn = req.cookies.get('isLoggedIn'); // Replace with your auth check

  if (!isLoggedIn) {
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.redirect(url); // Use redirect for better UX
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // Allows the request to continue normally
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
};
```

This improved middleware only redirects to `/login` if the `isLoggedIn` cookie is not found.  If the user is logged in, `NextResponse.next()` allows the request to proceed to its intended destination, preventing the infinite redirect.


## Explanation

The original code created an infinite redirect loop because it unconditionally redirected to `/login`. The corrected code introduces a conditional check (`isLoggedIn`) and uses `NextResponse.redirect()` to redirect only when necessary. `NextResponse.next()` is crucial for allowing requests to continue naturally when the redirect condition is false.  Using `NextResponse.rewrite()` for redirects is generally discouraged because it can lead to caching issues; `NextResponse.redirect()` is preferred for user-facing redirects.
