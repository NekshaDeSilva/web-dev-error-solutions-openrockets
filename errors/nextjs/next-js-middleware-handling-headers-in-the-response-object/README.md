# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers` in the Response Object


## Description of the Error

A common issue when working with Next.js Middleware is incorrectly manipulating the `headers` object within the `Response` object.  Specifically, attempting to directly modify the `headers` property often results in unexpected behavior or errors.  This is because the `headers` object in the `Response` isn't a mutable plain JavaScript object; it's an instance with specific methods for modification. Trying to assign properties directly (e.g., `response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'value')`) will not work as expected, and might lead to silent failures or your headers not being set properly.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume we want to add a custom header `X-Custom-Header` with the value `my-custom-value` to the response in our middleware.  The incorrect and correct approaches are demonstrated below:

**Incorrect Approach:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'my-custom-value'); // INCORRECT
  return response;
}
```

**Correct Approach:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req, res) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();

  // Correct way to add headers: Using the `headers` method of NextResponse.
  const updatedResponse = new NextResponse(response.body, {
    headers: {
      ...response.headers,
      'X-Custom-Header': 'my-custom-value',
    },
  });

  return updatedResponse;
}
```


**Explanation of the Fix:**

The correct approach uses the `NextResponse` constructor to create a *new* `Response` object.  We use the spread syntax (`...response.headers`) to copy all existing headers from the original `response` and then add our custom header.  This ensures that all headers are correctly handled and that our custom header is included.  Directly manipulating the `headers` property of the original `response` object won't persist the change.

## Summary

Remember to use the `NextResponse` constructor to create a new response object with the updated headers, rather than directly modifying the `headers` property of the existing response. This ensures that your header changes are correctly applied.
