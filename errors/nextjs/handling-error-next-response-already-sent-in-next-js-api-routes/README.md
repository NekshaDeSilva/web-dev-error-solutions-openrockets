# 🐞 Handling `Error: Next Response already sent` in Next.js API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when developing Next.js applications:  `Error: Next Response already sent`. This error typically arises in API routes when multiple responses are attempted within a single request handler.  Next.js API routes expect a single response object to be returned.  Attempting to send multiple responses, either explicitly or implicitly, results in this error.

## Description of the Error

The `Error: Next Response already sent` error in Next.js API routes indicates that your API route handler has attempted to send a response to the client more than once.  This often happens due to unexpected behavior like multiple `res.send()` or `res.json()` calls, or perhaps asynchronous operations completing after the initial response has already been sent.

## Example Scenario and Code Fix

Let's consider a scenario where an API route fetches data from two different sources asynchronously, and attempts to send a response after each fetch completes.

**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/data.js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const data1 = await fetchDataFromSource1();
  res.status(200).json({ data: data1 }); // First response

  const data2 = await fetchDataFromSource2();
  res.status(200).json({ data: data2 }); // Second (erroneous) response
}

async function fetchDataFromSource1() {
  // Simulate fetching data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return { source: 'source1', value: 'data1' };
}

async function fetchDataFromSource2() {
  // Simulate fetching data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return { source: 'source2', value: 'data2' };
}
```

This code will throw the `Error: Next Response already sent` because `res.status(200).json({ data: data2 })` is called after the first response has already been sent.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/data.js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  try {
    const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([
      fetchDataFromSource1(),
      fetchDataFromSource2(),
    ]);
    res.status(200).json({ data1, data2 });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });
  }
}

async function fetchDataFromSource1() {
  // Simulate fetching data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return { source: 'source1', value: 'data1' };
}

async function fetchDataFromSource2() {
  // Simulate fetching data
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  return { source: 'source2', value: 'data2' };
}
```

This revised code uses `Promise.all` to fetch both data sources concurrently.  Once both promises resolve, a single response is sent containing both datasets. The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during data fetching, providing a more robust solution.


## Explanation

The key to resolving this error is ensuring that only a single `res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.status()` (followed by a send method) or similar method is called within the API route handler.  If you have multiple asynchronous operations, use `Promise.all` or similar constructs to wait for all of them to complete before sending the response.  Error handling is also crucial to prevent unexpected behavior from causing this issue.
