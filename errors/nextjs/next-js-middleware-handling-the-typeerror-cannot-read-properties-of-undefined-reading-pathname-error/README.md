# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling the "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')" Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`. This usually occurs when accessing the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property within middleware before it's properly defined.  This often happens when attempting to conditionally redirect or modify the request based on the URL path.


## Description of the Error

The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` indicates that the `req.nextUrl` object, specifically its `pathname` property, is undefined when your middleware tries to access it.  This means the Next.js request object hasn't been fully populated with URL information at the point your code attempts to read it.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume you're trying to redirect users from `/old-page` to `/new-page` using middleware.  This is a common scenario where the error might occur.


**Incorrect Code (Will throw the error):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-page') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-page', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/old-page'
}
```

**Correct Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // clone the URL object
  if (url.pathname === '/old-page') {
    url.pathname = '/new-page';
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Use rewrite instead of redirect for better performance
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/old-page'
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Import `NextResponse`:** We explicitly import `NextResponse` to ensure correct usage.

2. **Cloning the URL:** The crucial fix is `const url = req.nextUrl.clone();`.  This creates a copy of the `req.nextUrl` object.  This is important because directly manipulating `req.nextUrl` can cause unexpected behavior.  By working with a clone, we avoid potential race conditions or unintended side effects.


3. **`NextResponse.rewrite()`:**  Instead of redirecting, we're now using `NextResponse.rewrite()`.  While `redirect` works, `rewrite` is generally preferred for middleware as it avoids a separate HTTP request, leading to better performance.


## Explanation

The `req.nextUrl` object is populated asynchronously by Next.js. If your middleware attempts to access `req.nextUrl.pathname` before it's ready, the `pathname` property will be undefined, resulting in the error. Cloning `req.nextUrl` provides a safe copy to manipulate without interfering with the original object's asynchronous population.  Using `rewrite` also ensures efficient handling of the redirection within the middleware context.
