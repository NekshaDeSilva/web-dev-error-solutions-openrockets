# 🐞 Next.js Middleware: Handling `redirect()` within `async` functions and preserving headers


## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware involves redirecting requests within an `async` function.  If you try to directly use `next.redirect()` inside a promise or asynchronous operation, the headers might not be correctly set, leading to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when setting cookies. The redirect might not take effect, or the associated cookies might not be sent properly to the client.  This is because the response object used in the middleware isn't correctly handled asynchronously.


## Code: Step-by-Step Fix

Let's assume we have a middleware function that checks for authentication and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page while setting a cookie indicating the redirection attempt.  This example shows the problematic code and then the corrected version.

**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('authToken');

  if (!token) {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          resolve(NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url), {
              headers: {
                  'Set-Cookie': `redirectAttempt=true; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; HttpOnly`
              }
          }))
      }, 1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    })
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // apply middleware only to routes under /protected
}
```

This code will likely not set the cookie correctly due to the asynchronous nature of the redirect within the promise.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('authToken');

  if (!token) {
    const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url), {
      headers: {
        'Set-Cookie': `redirectAttempt=true; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; HttpOnly`
      }
    });
    return response;
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],
}

```

The key change is removing the `Promise` and directly returning the `NextResponse` object from the `async` function.  This ensures proper handling of the response and headers.  The `async` keyword is crucial for enabling the `await` if needed within the function.


## Explanation

The original code's problem stems from the use of `setTimeout` and `Promise` inside the middleware function. `NextResponse.redirect()` needs to be returned directly from the middleware function to ensure the headers and redirect are properly handled by the Next.js server.  Using `async`/`await` allows you to handle asynchronous operations cleanly without interfering with the response object's handling.
