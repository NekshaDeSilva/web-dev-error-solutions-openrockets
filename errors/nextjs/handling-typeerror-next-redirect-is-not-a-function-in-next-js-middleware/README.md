# üêû Handling "TypeError: next.redirect is not a function" in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: `TypeError: next.redirect is not a function`. This error typically arises when attempting to use the `next.redirect()` function incorrectly within your middleware.  The `next.redirect()` function is only available *within the context of a middleware function's response*.  Incorrect placement or usage will trigger this error.

**Description of the Error:**

The `TypeError: next.redirect is not a function` error indicates that you're trying to call the `next.redirect()` method in a place where it's not defined.  This often happens when:

1. You're trying to use `next.redirect()` outside of a middleware function.
2. You're calling it incorrectly within the middleware function (e.g., in an asynchronous function outside of the `response.end`).
3. Your Middleware function's return statement is faulty.

**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**

Let's assume you have a middleware function intended to redirect users based on a condition (e.g., checking for authentication):


**Incorrect Code (Produces the Error):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    next.redirect('/login'); // Incorrect placement. next is not defined here.
  }
}
```

**Correct Code:**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // This is crucial to allow the request to continue if authenticated.
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import `NextResponse`:** The corrected code correctly imports `NextResponse` from `next/server`.  This is essential for using functions like `redirect` within middleware.

2. **Use `NextResponse.redirect()`:** The `next.redirect()` function is replaced with `NextResponse.redirect()`. This function takes a URL object as an argument which can be generated by `new URL('/login', req.url)` that will automatically prepend the request's origin to prevent issues with absolute URLs.


3. **Handle the Non-Redirect Case (`NextResponse.next()`):**  Crucially, we add `return NextResponse.next();`. This is important because middleware must explicitly return a response. If the user is authenticated, `NextResponse.next()` lets the request continue to the original route.  Failure to return something will lead to a 500 error.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** In a production environment, you should add robust error handling to catch unexpected situations and respond gracefully.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** If your authentication check or other logic in the middleware involves asynchronous operations (e.g., database calls), make sure to use `async/await` correctly to handle promises.  Avoid using the direct `next.redirect` inside the `then` block and instead return the `NextResponse` once the promise resolves.
