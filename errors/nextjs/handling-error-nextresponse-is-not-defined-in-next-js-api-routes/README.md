# üêû Handling `Error: NextResponse is not defined` in Next.js API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js API routes:  `Error: NextResponse is not defined`. This error arises when you attempt to use the `NextResponse` object within an API route without the correct import.  `NextResponse` is crucial for sending custom responses (e.g., setting headers, status codes, cookies) from your API routes.


**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: NextResponse is not defined` error indicates that the JavaScript interpreter in your API route cannot find the `NextResponse` object. This usually happens because you haven't imported it correctly from the `next/server` module, which is specific to the API routes environment in Next.js 13 and later.


**Code & Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's say you have an API route at `pages/api/hello.js` that's attempting to send a custom response:


**Incorrect Code (Will produce the error):**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const response = new NextResponse('Hello, Next.js!'); // Incorrect: NextResponse is not defined here
  res.status(200).json({ message: response });
}
```

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const response = new NextResponse('Hello, Next.js!'); //Correct: Now NextResponse is imported
  return response; // Important: return NextResponse object
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Import `NextResponse`:** We added `import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';` at the top of the file. This line imports the necessary object from the correct Next.js module.  This is crucial for working with API routes in Next.js 13+.  Older versions use different methods.
2. **Return `NextResponse`:**  Instead of using the `res` object (which is designed for older API routes), we now return the `NextResponse` object directly. This is how you send customized responses in the new API Routes architecture. Using `res` will cause problems and is deprecated.

**Alternative Example with JSON Response:**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  const data = { message: 'Hello, Next.js from JSON!' };
  return NextResponse.json(data); //Use NextResponse.json for JSON responses
}
```

* **Next.js `NextResponse` API:**  (Look for the `NextResponse` section within the API routes documentation - the exact link depends on the Next.js version)


**Important Note:**  The use of `res` object in the way shown in the initial incorrect code is incompatible with the `NextResponse` approach.  Attempting to mix them will lead to errors.  Always use `NextResponse` exclusively when building API routes in the new architecture.
