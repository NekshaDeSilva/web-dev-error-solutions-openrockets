# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')`


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware, specifically when attempting to access locale information from the request object before it's properly populated.  This often happens when trying to redirect based on locale preferences early in the middleware chain.


## Description of the Error

The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')` arises when your middleware attempts to access `req.locale` or a similar property within the request object (`req`) before Next.js has fully processed the request and assigned the locale information. This typically occurs when the middleware runs too early in the pipeline, before Next.js's i18n (internationalization) features have had a chance to extract and set the locale.


## Code and Fixing Steps

Let's assume you have a middleware file (`middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`) aiming to redirect users to a specific locale based on their browser's preferred language:


**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// middleware.js (INCORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const locale = req.locale; // ERROR: req.locale might be undefined here!
  if (locale === 'es') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))
  }
  // ...other logic...
}
```

**Corrected Code:**

This issue can be fixed by ensuring the `req.locale` is available. This often means waiting for the i18n pipeline to complete, or using the `NextRequest` object properly:

```javascript
// middleware.js (CORRECTED)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl;
  const locale = url.locale; // Access locale from NextRequest's nextUrl

  if (locale === 'es') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))
  }
  // ... other logic ...

}
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
}
```

**Explanation of the fix:**

Instead of directly accessing `req.locale`, we now access the `locale` property from `req.nextUrl`.  The `req.nextUrl` object is properly populated with locale information at the point the middleware is invoked, even at earlier stages in the request processing pipeline. This method reliably retrieves the user's locale without encountering the `undefined` error.


The `config.matcher` ensures the middleware does not interfere with static assets or API routes.

## Explanation

The core problem lies in the timing of accessing the `req.locale`.  Middleware runs *before* Next.js has completely processed the request and assigned the locale.  By using `req.nextUrl.locale`, we access the locale information after it has been correctly assigned by the Next.js routing system, thereby avoiding the `undefined` error.  Using `config.matcher` correctly prevents the middleware from being unnecessarily applied to routes and file paths which are not pertinent to the context of the error.
