# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object`


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object`.  This error occurs when your middleware function doesn't return a valid `Response` object, preventing the middleware from properly handling requests.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object` explicitly states the problem.  Your middleware function, designed to intercept and modify requests before they reach the page component or API route, isn't returning an object of the type `Response`. This is crucial because Next.js relies on the `Response` object to understand how to handle the request (e.g., redirecting, setting headers, modifying the response body).  The middleware will fail if it returns `undefined`, `null`, a plain JavaScript object, or a promise that doesn't resolve to a `Response` object.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume you have a middleware function that attempts to redirect based on authentication status:

**Incorrect Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return { redirect: { destination: '/login', permanent: false } }; // INCORRECT!
  }
}
```

This code is flawed because it returns a plain JavaScript object instead of a `Response` object.  This will result in the error.

**Corrected Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // Continue to the original request
}


//Helper function (replace with your actual authentication logic)
function checkAuthentication(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token'); //Example - Replace with your token retrieval
  return !!token; //Return true if token exists, false otherwise
}

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected version utilizes `NextResponse` from `next/server`. This object provides methods for creating valid `Response` objects.  `NextResponse.redirect()` creates a redirect response, and `NextResponse.next()` allows the request to proceed to the intended destination.  Crucially, we're using `new URL('/login', req.url)` to construct a properly formatted URL for the redirect, ensuring it's relative to the original request's URL.

* **NextResponse API Reference:**  (You'll find this within the Next.js documentation linked above.  Look for the section on `NextResponse`.)


**Summary:**

The key to avoiding the `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object` is to always return a valid `Response` object from your middleware function.  Use `NextResponse` to create these responses, ensuring your middleware behaves as intended.  Remember to handle both success and failure scenarios (e.g., redirection vs. continuing the request).
