# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `request.nextUrl.pathname`  in Redirects


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using Next.js Middleware to perform redirects based on the original request URL.  Specifically, it tackles situations where manipulating `request.nextUrl.pathname` doesn't correctly reflect in the final redirect URL.


**Description of the Error:**

When attempting to redirect based on logic applied to `request.nextUrl.pathname` within middleware, the resulting redirect might not always behave as expected.  The redirect might point to an incorrect path, potentially leading to a 404 error or an unexpected page being displayed. This often happens when modifications to `request.nextUrl.pathname` are not properly handled by the underlying Next.js routing system, particularly when combined with other URL parameters or query strings.


**Code Example: Incorrect Implementation**

Let's say you want to redirect all requests to `/blog/*` to `/articles/*`. An incorrect implementation might look like this:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {
    req.nextUrl.pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname.replace('/blog', '/articles');
    return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/blog/:path*'],
};
```

This approach *might* appear to work in some cases, but it's unreliable and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex URLs or query parameters.  The `rewrite` method might not correctly handle all aspects of the URL modification.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

The correct approach is to construct a new URL object using the `NextResponse.redirect()` method.  This ensures that the entire URL is properly updated, including query parameters:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl;

  if (pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {
    const newPathname = pathname.replace('/blog', '/articles');
    const newUrl = new URL(req.url);  // Create a new URL object
    newUrl.pathname = newPathname;      // Set the new pathname

    return NextResponse.redirect(newUrl); // Redirect using the updated URL object
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/blog/:path*'],
};
```

This revised code creates a new `URL` object from the original request URL. Then, it modifies only the `pathname` property within this new object, ensuring that other parts of the URL (like query parameters) remain unchanged. Finally, it uses `NextResponse.redirect()` with the correctly constructed URL, guaranteeing a reliable redirect.


**Explanation:**

The problem with the initial approach stems from directly manipulating `req.nextUrl`.  While it might seem convenient, the internal mechanisms of Next.js might not fully recognize these in-place changes. Creating a new `URL` object provides a cleaner and more reliable way to construct the intended redirect target, ensuring that all URL components are properly handled by the routing system.
