# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Response already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "Response already sent" error. This typically occurs when you attempt to modify the response object multiple times within the middleware function, leading to conflicting actions.  The browser receives the response before the middleware completes its intended processing, resulting in the error.


## Description of the Error

The `Response already sent` error in Next.js Middleware usually manifests as a server-side error. It indicates that your middleware function has already sent a response to the client, preventing subsequent modifications to the response object.  This is often caused by accidentally calling `next()` or returning a response more than once.


## Code Example and Fixing Steps

Let's assume we have middleware attempting to redirect users based on a condition, but inadvertently sends a response twice.

**Problem Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.headers.authorization === 'invalid-token') {
    res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' });
    res.end(); // <--- This line causes the problem if next() is called after.
    console.log("First response sent")
    next(); // <-- attempts to modify the response again AFTER already sent.  ERROR
  }
  else{
    console.log("no redirection needed")
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile'],
}
```

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Identify the redundant response:** The primary issue lies in the `res.end()` call in the `if` block. After this, attempting to call `next()` results in the error.


2. **Conditional Response:**  Instead of using `res.end()` and `next()` separately, use a conditional return statement that determines whether to redirect or call `next()`  to proceed to the next middleware function or page handler.


**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res, next) {
  if (req.headers.authorization === 'invalid-token') {
    return res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' }); //Correct: single response handling
  }
    console.log("no redirection needed")
  next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile'],
}
```

This corrected code ensures only one response is sent to the client. If the authorization header is invalid, a redirect is initiated.  Otherwise, `next()` is called to allow processing to continue to the next middleware function (if any) or the page handler.


## Explanation

The `Response already sent` error highlights the importance of controlling the flow of responses in Next.js Middleware.  Each middleware function has the responsibility of either modifying the response and sending it directly to the client, or calling `next()` to pass control to the next middleware in the chain or the actual page handler.  Mixing these two approaches within a single middleware function without proper conditional logic will invariably result in the error.
