# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Response already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "Response already sent" error. This typically occurs when you attempt to send a response from middleware more than once, or when middleware interacts unexpectedly with other response-modifying features.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Response already sent` error in Next.js Middleware manifests when your middleware attempts to modify the response after it has already been fully sent to the client. This can happen due to multiple `response.redirect()` or `response.setHeader()` calls, or conflicting actions between middleware and API routes/pages.  The error message itself may vary slightly depending on the underlying cause, but the core problem remains the same.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say we have middleware that checks authentication and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. If we inadvertently make multiple redirect calls within the middleware or have another part of the code that attempts to alter the response, the error arises.

**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's assume the following faulty middleware code:


```javascript
// middleware.js (Faulty)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  // Faulty part: Additional response modification
  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'This will cause an error');  

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
};
```

This code will throw the error because it attempts both a redirect and sets an additional header.  The correct approach is to ensure only one response modification happens.

**Step 1: Identify the source of multiple responses.**

Carefully review your middleware code, looking for multiple calls to functions like `NextResponse.redirect()`, `NextResponse.rewrite()`, or any other function that modifies the response object.


**Step 2: Refactor for a single response.**


```javascript
// middleware.js (Corrected)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
};
```

This revised code ensures that only one response action occurs‚Äîeither redirection or proceeding to the next handler.


**Explanation:**

The key is to structure your middleware to handle only one response action. Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) are helpful in deciding which action to take based on different conditions. Avoid multiple `return` statements within the same code block that modify the response. If you need multiple conditions leading to different response modifications, make sure only one is executed for each request.
