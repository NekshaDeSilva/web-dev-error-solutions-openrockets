# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers` object manipulation for redirects


This document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware to redirect users based on specific conditions.  The problem often stems from incorrectly manipulating the `headers` object within the middleware function, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.


## Description of the Error

A typical scenario involves attempting to set headers for a redirect using `response.headers.set('Location', '/new-location')`.  However, this approach might not work as expected.  Instead of a clean redirect, you might see errors or the redirection failing altogether.  The core problem is that Next.js Middleware handles redirects differently than a standard HTTP response; directly modifying the `headers` object doesn't always trigger the expected redirect behavior.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume we want to redirect users to `/login` if they are not authenticated.  Here's the incorrect and correct implementation:


**Incorrect Implementation:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic here

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    res.headers.set('Location', '/login'); // INCORRECT: This doesn't reliably trigger a redirect
    res.statusCode = 307; // Attempting to set status code
    res.end();
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

**Correct Implementation:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic here

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```


**Explanation of the Fix:**

The correct implementation uses `NextResponse.redirect()`. This is the recommended and reliable way to perform redirects within Next.js Middleware.  `NextResponse` is a dedicated object provided by Next.js for managing responses.  `new URL('/login', req.url)` constructs a full URL for the redirect, ensuring correctness even with relative paths.  The `return` statement is crucial; it signals to Next.js that a redirect should occur.  The incorrect implementation attempts to manipulate headers directly, which doesn't always work reliably with the middleware's internal redirection mechanism.

## Explanation

The primary reason the initial approach fails is due to how Next.js handles internal redirects within its middleware system.  Directly manipulating the `headers` and `statusCode` properties bypasses Next.js's internal redirection mechanism, leading to inconsistent behavior.  `NextResponse.redirect()` correctly leverages this internal mechanism, ensuring a reliable and predictable redirect.  Using this approach avoids potential conflicts and ensures that the redirection works correctly across various scenarios and versions of Next.js.
