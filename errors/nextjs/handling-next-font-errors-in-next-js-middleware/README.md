# üêû Handling `next/font` Errors in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common issue encountered when using `next/font` within Next.js Middleware, specifically the error related to attempting to access the `next/font` module's functionality in an environment where it's not designed to operate.  This typically happens when trying to load and use fonts directly within middleware functions.

**Description of the Error:**

The error message usually resembles something like: "Error: You can only use `next/font` inside a React component."  This happens because `next/font` relies on the React rendering context, which isn't available within the serverless environment of middleware functions or API routes.  Middleware functions execute on the server before the actual React component tree is rendered.

**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**

The solution is to *not* use `next/font` within Middleware. Instead, handle font loading within your React components where it's designed to work.


**Incorrect (Error-Causing) Code (Example):**

```javascript
// pages/api/my-route.js (API Route - Incorrect)
import { Inter } from 'next/font/inter';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export default function handler(req, res) {
  // ... attempting to use inter.className here will cause an error ...
  res.status(200).json({ text: 'Hello' });
}
```

```javascript
//middleware.js (Middleware - Incorrect)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/inter';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export function middleware(req) {
  // ... attempting to use inter.className here will also cause an error ...
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

**Correct Code (React Component):**

```javascript
// pages/index.js (or any other page component)
import { Inter } from 'next/font/inter';
import Head from 'next/head';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>My Next.js App</title>
      </Head>
      <main className={`${inter.className} p-4`}>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>This text uses the Inter font.</p>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code moves the `next/font` import and usage into a React component (`pages/index.js` in this example).  This ensures that the font is loaded and applied *after* the React component has mounted and the React rendering context is available. Middleware and API routes operate outside of this context; they are purely server-side functions.

* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware): Explains the purpose and limitations of Next.js Middleware.  This will clarify why certain functionalities (like client-side rendering dependent modules) are unavailable.
* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction): Provides information on API routes and their server-side execution context.


**Conclusion:**

Understanding the context in which different Next.js features operate is crucial for avoiding errors.  `next/font` is specifically designed for client-side rendering within React components. Attempting to use it elsewhere will lead to runtime errors. Always remember to load and apply your fonts within your React components.
