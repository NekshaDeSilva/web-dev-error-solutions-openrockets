# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `next/navigation` in `GET` requests


## Description of the Error

A common issue when using Next.js Middleware with `next/navigation`'s client-side routing functions (like `useRouter.push`, `useRouter.replace`, etc.) is encountering errors, particularly in `GET` requests.  Middleware runs on the server during the request phase, before the page's component is rendered.  Client-side navigation APIs are designed for browser-side manipulation after the page has loaded.  Attempting to directly call these within middleware intended for a `GET` request often leads to errors because the browser context isn't available.  The middleware will throw errors and fail to correctly redirect or manipulate navigation.


## Code Example: The Problem

Let's say you're trying to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page using middleware:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router' // INCORRECT usage here

export function middleware(req) {
  const router = useRouter() // This will throw an error
  if (!req.cookies.get('auth_token')) {
    router.push('/login') // This will FAIL in Middleware GET Request.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```


## Step-by-Step Fix

The solution is to avoid client-side navigation functions like `useRouter` entirely within the middleware.  Instead, leverage `NextResponse.redirect` to handle server-side redirects:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  if (!req.cookies.get('auth_token')) {
    // Correctly redirect using NextResponse
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

This corrected version uses `NextResponse.redirect` which is a server-side function, properly manipulating the response to redirect the user before the client even receives the initial HTML.


## Explanation

The core difference lies in the execution context.  `useRouter` is a React Hook, designed to be used *within* a React component *on the client-side*.  Middleware, on the other hand, runs on the server *before* the React component is rendered.  Using `useRouter` in the middleware tries to access the client-side context prematurely, causing an error.  `NextResponse` operates entirely within the server-side context of the request and response cycle, making it the correct tool for redirecting within middleware.
