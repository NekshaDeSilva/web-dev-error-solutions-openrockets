# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error. This typically occurs when you try to set headers in your middleware function after some content has already been sent to the client. This can happen due to unintended output from your middleware or other parts of your application.

**Description of the Error:**

The `headers already sent` error in Next.js (and Node.js in general) arises when your server attempts to send HTTP headers *after* it has already started sending the response body.  HTTP requires that headers be sent *before* the body. Once the body begins to be streamed, sending headers becomes impossible, resulting in this error.  This is often subtle, stemming from accidental logging, early execution of `res.end()`, or even unintended whitespace in your code before the `res.writeHead()` or `res.setHeader()` calls.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's imagine you have middleware intended to redirect unauthorized users:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js  (or similar auth setup)
// ... your existing authentication code ...

// pages/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (!req.session.user) {
    console.log("Unauthorized user accessing:", req.url); // PROBLEM: This might log to console *before* headers are sent
    res.redirect('/login');
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/*'],
};
```

The `console.log` statement, seemingly innocuous, can cause the error if the logging mechanism writes to the response before `res.redirect` sets the necessary headers.

**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Here's how to resolve the issue, applying best practices to prevent future occurrences:


1. **Identify the Culprit:** Carefully examine your middleware function (`pages/middleware.js` or wherever your middleware resides).  Look for any potential source of early output. This includes:
    * **`console.log` statements:**  Move all console logs *after* header setting and redirection.  Better yet, use a structured logging system (like Winston or Pino) that buffers until after the response is fully handled.
    * **Accidental `res.write` or `res.end` calls:** Ensure no unintended calls to these methods precede your header manipulation.
    * **Whitespace or comments before the header functions:**  Carefully check for leading spaces, tabs, or comments at the beginning of the file, especially before your middleware logic starts.

2. **Rewrite the Middleware:**  Here's a corrected version of our example middleware:

```javascript
// pages/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (!req.session.user) {
    // Correct approach: Redirect *after* ensuring no other output is made.
    res.redirect('/login');
    return; // Crucial to stop further execution
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/*'],
};
```

3. **Error Handling and Logging:** To further robust your code, consider adding error handling:

```javascript
export function middleware(req, res) {
  try {
    if (!req.session.user) {
      res.redirect('/login');
      return;
    }
    // ...rest of your middleware logic...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in middleware:", error);
    // Handle the error appropriately, perhaps with a 500 response.
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The key change is the explicit `return` statement after `res.redirect`.  This prevents any further code execution in the middleware function after the response has begun.  Without this, any subsequent statements (even seemingly harmless ones) could trigger the error.  Adding a `try...catch` block enhances robustness by handling unexpected errors gracefully.
