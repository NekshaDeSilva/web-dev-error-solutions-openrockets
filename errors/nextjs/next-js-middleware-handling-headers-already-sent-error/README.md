# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error. This typically occurs when you attempt to set headers in your middleware after data has already been sent to the client, often due to unintended outputs before the `next()` function call.

**Description of the Error:**

The "headers already sent" error in Next.js Middleware indicates that your middleware function has already begun sending a response to the client (e.g., by implicitly or explicitly printing data) before calling `next()`.  This prevents you from modifying headers, which are typically set before the main response body. The error message itself might vary slightly depending on the underlying server environment, but the core problem is always the same: premature response generation.

**Scenario:**  Imagine you're trying to redirect users based on a condition in your middleware. If something outputs data (even a simple log statement) *before* the `next()` function call which handles the redirect, this error occurs.

**Code Example with Error (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  console.log("Middleware triggered!"); // This might cause the error if unhandled.
  if (req.url === '/secret') {
    if (req.cookies.isLoggedIn) {
      next();
    } else {
      res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' }); // Redirect
      res.end();
    }
  }
}
```

**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**

1. **Identify the Source:** Carefully examine your middleware function. Look for any `console.log` statements, accidental `res.send()` or `res.write()` calls outside of your conditional logic, or any unintentional output before `next()` is called.


2. **Ensure Proper Conditional Logic:** Ensure your logic for redirecting or setting headers is properly contained within an `if` statement or other conditional structure.  Make sure that the `res.writeHead` (or similar header-setting functions) and `res.end()` are only called in branches where they are needed.


3. **Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res, next) {
  if (req.url === '/secret') {
    if (req.cookies.isLoggedIn) {
      next(); // Allow access if logged in
    } else {
      res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' });
      res.end();
    }
  } else {
    next(); // Allow other requests to continue
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code explicitly handles all possible paths within the middleware. By placing the `res.writeHead` and `res.end` inside the `else` block of the conditional and adding a `next()` statement for other requests, we ensure that the headers are only set when the redirect is necessary, and that other requests pass through unaffected.  The critical change is that nothing is sent to the response before the conditional logic decides the appropriate action.

**Note:**  If your problem persists, double check for any other unintended output such as accidentally calling an external API that sends a response before your `res.end()`
