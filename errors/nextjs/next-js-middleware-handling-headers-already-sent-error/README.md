# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to set headers in your middleware after data has already been sent to the client, often due to unintended output before the `Response.rewrite()` or `Response.redirect()` calls.

**Description of the Error:**

The "headers already sent" error manifests as a 500 Internal Server Error in your browser.  The server-side logs will usually indicate that the response headers have already been sent before your middleware attempted to modify them (e.g., through a `Response.setHeader()` call).  This prevents the middleware from properly redirecting or rewriting the response.

**Scenario:**

Let's consider a middleware function intended to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.  The error arises if there's any unintended output (even whitespace or a stray `console.log`) before the `Response.redirect()` call.

**Code with the Error (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  console.log("Middleware is running") // This seemingly harmless line can cause the error!
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // Only run middleware for protected paths
}
```

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Identify Unintended Output:** Carefully review your middleware function, particularly focusing on code executed *before* the `NextResponse.redirect()` or `NextResponse.rewrite()` call.  Look for any accidental `console.log` statements, whitespace errors (e.g., extra newlines at the beginning of the file), or even unintentional calls to `res.send()` or `res.json()` if you‚Äôre mistakenly mixing API Route style with Middleware.

2. **Remove/Comment Out Suspect Code:** Comment out or delete any suspicious code sections to isolate the source of the problem. Test after each removal to pinpoint the culprit.

3. **Ensure Proper `NextResponse` Usage:**  Always use `NextResponse` functions (such as `NextResponse.redirect`, `NextResponse.rewrite`, and `NextResponse.next()`) to modify and return the response.  Avoid using `Response` from Node.js directly within Next.js Middleware.  This is crucial because Next.js Middleware's `Response` object is different and expects this structure.


**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],
}
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code removes the `console.log` statement, which was causing the unintended output that led to the "headers already sent" error.  By ensuring that only `NextResponse` methods are used to manipulate the response, we guarantee compatibility with Next.js Middleware's internal workings.
