# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Headers Already Sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Headers Already Sent` error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to set headers in your middleware after the response has already started being sent to the client.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Headers Already Sent` error indicates that your middleware function is trying to modify HTTP headers (e.g., setting cookies, redirecting) after the response stream has begun. This usually happens due to unintended output or conflicting interactions with other middleware functions or components.  The browser receives a partial or incomplete response, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Full Code of Fixing Step by Step:**

Let's consider a scenario where we're trying to redirect users to a login page if they're not authenticated.  The following erroneous middleware code might trigger the error:

```javascript
// middleware.js (Incorrect)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token')

  if (!token) {
    console.log("Redirecting...") // This can cause the error if logging is done after response.redirect()
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
    console.log("After Redirect") // This line will never execute
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*']
}
```

The problem is often subtle.  Even seemingly innocuous `console.log` statements *after* a redirect or other header-setting operation can trigger this error.

Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
// middleware.js (Corrected)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token')

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*']
}
```

The fix simply removes any code that executes after the `NextResponse.redirect()` call.  The middleware function should return a `NextResponse` object immediately after setting headers or initiating a redirect.


**Explanation:**

The key to understanding this error lies in the asynchronous nature of HTTP responses. Once the response stream starts (e.g., by sending a redirect or writing data to the response body), you can't modify the headers anymore.  The order of operations within the middleware function is critical.  Avoid any operations that generate output (including logging) after you've initiated a redirect or set crucial headers.
