# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error.  This error typically arises when you attempt to send HTTP headers after the response has already begun to be sent to the client.  This often occurs due to unintended output before a proper `Response` object is created and sent.


## Description of the Error

The "headers already sent" error manifests as a server-side error in your Next.js application. It prevents your Middleware from properly manipulating the HTTP response, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially a broken user experience.  The error message itself will usually clearly state that headers have already been sent, sometimes pinpointing a specific line of code in your middleware.


## Code Example and Fix:


Let's assume we have a middleware function that attempts to set a custom header, but inadvertently sends output before doing so:


**Problematic Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  console.log("Middleware is running"); // Unintentional output!

  const res = NextResponse.next();
  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'hello');
  return res;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

The `console.log` statement, seemingly harmless, is the culprit. It generates output before the `NextResponse` object is created and sent.

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Identify the culprit:** Carefully examine your middleware function for any unintentional output before calling `NextResponse`. This includes `console.log`, accidental string outputs, or any other functions that might implicitly send data to the client.

2. **Encapsulate output:** If you need logging or debugging, use a logging library that buffers output or only logs to the server.  Avoid direct console output within the middleware function.

3. **Correct Middleware Function:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.next();
  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'hello');
  return res;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

In this corrected version, the `console.log` is removed, ensuring that no output is generated before `NextResponse` is used.



## Explanation

Next.js Middleware operates at a low level, intercepting requests before they reach your pages or API routes.  The HTTP protocol dictates a specific order of operations: headers are sent first, followed by the response body.  If you try to send headers after data has already been sent to the client (even something seemingly innocuous like a console log), the server throws the "headers already sent" error.
