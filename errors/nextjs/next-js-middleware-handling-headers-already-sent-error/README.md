# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers already sent` Error


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error. This error typically occurs when you try to send a response multiple times within a middleware function, often due to unintended side effects or incorrect usage of response modification methods.


## Description of the Error

The "headers already sent" error in Next.js Middleware manifests when the server attempts to send HTTP headers (like status codes, content types, etc.) after it has already initiated the response. This is a fatal error that prevents the server from correctly processing the request and results in an unhandled exception, disrupting the application's functionality.  The exact error message might vary slightly depending on the server environment, but the core issue is always the same: a double (or more) attempt to send a response.


## Code Example and Fix: Incorrect Middleware Function

Let's consider an example of a faulty middleware function that triggers the error:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Middleware!' }); // First response
    console.log("Something happens after response sent")
    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'test'); // Attempting to send headers after first response
  }
}
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/about'],
}
```

This code is flawed because it attempts to send the headers (`res.setHeader`) *after* already sending a full response (`res.status(200).json`). This causes the "headers already sent" error.


## Step-by-Step Fix

To resolve the issue, ensure you send the headers and the response body in a single operation.  We'll modify the middleware function to correct this:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'test');
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Middleware!' }); //Headers and Response sent together.
  }
}
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/about'],
}
```

Now, both the header and the response body are sent as a single, unified operation, preventing the "headers already sent" error.  The order matters; set headers *before* calling `res.json()`, `res.send()`, or other methods that send the response body.



## Explanation

The core reason for this error is the underlying HTTP protocol.  Once the HTTP response headers are sent, the server implicitly signals the beginning of the response body.  Any attempt to modify headers (or even the status code) after this point violates the protocol and triggers the error.  Next.js Middleware functions need to be carefully designed to prevent this scenario.  Avoid sending partial responses or attempting to modify the response after the initial response has been initiated.
