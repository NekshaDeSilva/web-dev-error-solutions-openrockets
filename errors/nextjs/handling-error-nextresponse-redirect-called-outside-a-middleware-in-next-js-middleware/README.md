# üêû Handling `Error: NextResponse.redirect() called outside a middleware` in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware:  `Error: NextResponse.redirect() called outside a middleware`. This error arises when you attempt to use `NextResponse.redirect()` from a location within your Next.js application where it's not supported.  `NextResponse.redirect()` is specifically designed for use within middleware functions.


**Description of the Error:**

The error message `Error: NextResponse.redirect() called outside a middleware` clearly indicates that you're trying to use the `NextResponse.redirect()` method from a place other than a middleware function. This method is part of the Next.js API for manipulating responses within the middleware lifecycle, and attempting to use it elsewhere will result in this error.


**Code Example Demonstrating the Error and its Fix:**

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have a `pages/api/redirect.js` file (an API route, not a middleware):

```javascript
// pages/api/redirect.js (INCORRECT - will throw the error)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function POST(req) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/about', req.url));
}
```

This code will throw the error because it's trying to use `NextResponse.redirect()` within an API route, not a middleware.

**Step-by-step Fix:**

To correctly redirect, you must move the redirection logic into a middleware function.  Here's how to do it:

1. **Create a middleware file:** Create a file named `middleware.js` (or any filename ending in `.js`) inside the `pages` directory.

2. **Import necessary modules:**

```javascript
// pages/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
```

3. **Implement the redirection logic:**

```javascript
// pages/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();

  // Check if the request path matches a specific route
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/api/redirect') {
    url.pathname = '/about'; //Redirect to /about
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }


  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/api/redirect', // only match /api/redirect route
};
```

Now, any request to `/api/redirect` will be intercepted by the middleware and redirected to `/about`.


**Explanation:**

The key difference lies in the context.  Middleware functions execute *before* a request reaches the page or API route, allowing you to modify the request or response.  API routes and page components execute *after* the middleware has had a chance to process the request. Using `NextResponse` in the correct context (Middleware) is crucial for this to work.  The `matcher` property in the `config` object is essential; it tells Next.js which paths the middleware should intercept. Without it, the middleware could potentially intercept and interfere with other parts of your application.
