# üêû Handling `Error: NextResponse.redirect() is not a function` in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: `Error: NextResponse.redirect() is not a function`. This error typically arises from incorrectly importing or using the `NextResponse` object within your middleware.  It means you're trying to use the `redirect()` method on something that isn't a `NextResponse` object.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: NextResponse.redirect() is not a function` error occurs when you attempt to call the `redirect()` method on a variable that hasn't been correctly assigned a `NextResponse` object. This happens frequently due to incorrect import statements or attempting to use `NextResponse` in a context where it isn't available (e.g., within a regular component or API route that doesn't support it).

**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's assume you have a middleware function intended to redirect users based on a certain condition:

**Incorrect Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js  (INCORRECT - This will throw the error)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.url;
  if (url.includes('/admin')) {
    // INCORRECT:  `redirect` is not a function on an object that's not a NextResponse object
    return redirect('/login'); 
  }
}
```

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js (CORRECTED)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.url;
  if (url.includes('/admin')) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
  return NextResponse.next(); //Important: Always return a NextResponse object
}

// pages/api/middleware.js (Alternative using a different redirect method)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req, res) {
    const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
    if (url.pathname.includes('/admin')) {
        url.pathname = '/login';
        return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
    }
    return NextResponse.next(); //Important: Always return a NextResponse object
}

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code demonstrates two key changes:

1. **Correct Import:** We correctly import `NextResponse` from `next/server`.  This is crucial.

2. **Correct Usage:**  Instead of directly calling `redirect()`, we create a new `NextResponse` object using `NextResponse.redirect()`.  The `redirect()` method takes a URL as an argument.  This URL needs to be a URL object, which is created with `new URL('/login', req.url)` in the first example. The second example shows how to use `NextResponse.rewrite`, which modifies the current request's URL without a full redirect, which can be beneficial for SEO.  Crucially, we always explicitly return a `NextResponse` object, either `NextResponse.redirect()` or `NextResponse.next()` (which continues to the next middleware or the requested page).

**Conclusion:**

The `Error: NextResponse.redirect() is not a function` error is usually caused by an incorrect usage of the `NextResponse` object within your Next.js middleware.  By ensuring correct imports and using `NextResponse` methods appropriately, you can resolve this error and implement successful redirects within your application.
