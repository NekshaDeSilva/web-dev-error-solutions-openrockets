# üêû Handling `ReferenceError: process is not defined` in Next.js API Routes


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js API routes: `ReferenceError: process is not defined`. This error arises because API routes run in a Node.js environment, but certain libraries or code snippets assume a browser environment where the global `process` object is not available.


**Description of the Error:**

The `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error means your API route code is attempting to access the `process` object, which is a global object in Node.js but not in a browser context. This typically occurs when you're using libraries or code that depend on Node.js-specific functionalities within your API route.  Next.js API routes run server-side in a Node.js environment, but some libraries might inadvertently try to access browser-specific APIs, leading to this conflict.


**Example Scenario:**  Using a library that relies on `process.env` to access environment variables within the API route, but the library is not properly handled for the server-side environment.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume you're using a library called `my-node-library` which relies on `process.env`.  The incorrect code might look like this:

```javascript
// pages/api/my-route.js
import myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; //Error occurs here in browser environment
  const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey);
  res.status(200).json(data);
}
```

**Corrected Code:**

The solution is to conditionally handle the access to `process.env` depending on the environment.  We can use the `process.browser` variable check (added in Next.js 13) to determine if we're in a browser environment:

```javascript
// pages/api/my-route.js
import myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  let apiKey;
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') { //Check for server-side
    apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
  } else {
    // Handle the case where you are in a browser environment (if needed - unlikely in API routes)
    //This is a fallback - API routes should not run in browser
    console.error('API routes should not run in browser environment.');
    apiKey = null; // Or fetch the key from a browser storage mechanism
  }

  if (apiKey){
    const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey);
    res.status(200).json(data);
  } else {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'API Key not found' });
  }
}

```

Alternatively, if the library allows for it, configure the library to not use `process.env` directly:

```javascript
//pages/api/my-route.js
import myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || 'fallbackApiKey'; //Provide a fallback

  const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey); //Assumes myNodeLibrary supports this configuration
  res.status(200).json(data);
}
```

This revised code explicitly checks if the `process` object exists before accessing it, preventing the error.  The use of `typeof window === 'undefined'` is crucial here since `process` will not exist in the browser environment, and `window` will not exist in the server environment.


**Explanation:**

The `process` object is a Node.js global that provides information about the current process.  Next.js API routes run on the server, so this object is available. However, if a library or code snippet tries to use it in a client-side context (e.g., within a regular Next.js component), it will be undefined, leading to the error.  The provided solution ensures the code only attempts to access `process.env` when it's guaranteed to exist.
