# 🐞 Next.js API Routes: Handling Large Responses and Avoiding Memory Leaks


## Description of the Error

A common problem when working with Next.js API routes is exceeding the Node.js process's memory limit when handling large responses, particularly when streaming or processing large files. This can manifest as crashes, errors like "FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory", or simply unresponsive APIs.  The issue arises because the entire response needs to be buffered in memory before being sent to the client.  This becomes problematic with large datasets or file uploads.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code Example)

Let's illustrate this with an example API route that processes a large CSV file and streams the processed data back to the client.  We'll avoid memory issues by using streams.


**Problem Code (Will cause memory leak with large files):**

```javascript
// pages/api/processCSV.js
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import csvParser from 'csv-parser';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed
  }

  try {
    const { file } = req.body; // Assuming file is uploaded via FormData

    const data = await fs.readFile(file.path, 'utf8'); // Reads the whole file into memory!
    const rows = await csvParser().parse(data);  // Processes in memory!

    res.status(200).json(rows);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).end();
  }
}

```

**Solution Code (Streaming):**

```javascript
// pages/api/processCSV.js
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';
import { pipeline } from 'stream/promises';
import csvParser from 'csv-parser';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed
  }

  try {
    const { file } = req.body;

    const results = [];
    await pipeline(
      createReadStream(file.path),
      csvParser(),
      async (row) => results.push(row), // collect rows
    );

    // Stream the results (if you have very large datasets, consider chunking):
    res.status(200).json(results); //this could be replaced with a streaming json library for massive files


  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).end();
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The problematic code reads the entire CSV file into memory using `fs.readFile`.  This is fine for small files, but catastrophic for large ones. The solution uses `createReadStream` to read the file as a stream, processing it line by line using `csv-parser`.  This prevents loading the entire file into memory at once.  `pipeline` handles the asynchronous flow gracefully.  For extremely large files, consider streaming the JSON response as well instead of building the `results` array completely in memory.
