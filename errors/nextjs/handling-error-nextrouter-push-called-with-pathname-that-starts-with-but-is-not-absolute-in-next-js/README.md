# üêû Handling `Error: NextRouter.push called with pathname that starts with '/' but is not absolute` in Next.js


This document addresses a common error encountered when using `NextRouter.push` within Next.js applications, particularly within API routes or middleware.  The error message typically reads: `Error: NextRouter.push called with pathname that starts with '/' but is not absolute`.

This error arises because `NextRouter.push` expects a fully qualified URL, including the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and domain,  when navigating outside the current application context.  Using a relative path (`/some-page`) within an API route or middleware function, which execute outside the client-side rendering environment, will trigger this error.

## Description of the Error

The core issue is a mismatch between the context where `NextRouter.push` is called and the type of path provided. Client-side routing (within components rendered in the browser) allows relative paths.  However, server-side contexts, such as API routes and middleware, require absolute paths because they don't inherently understand the application's base URL.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

Let's assume you have an API route that needs to redirect the user after a successful action.

**Incorrect Code (Causes the error):**

```javascript
// pages/api/updateUser.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req) {
  const { name } = await req.json();
  // ... update user logic ...

  // INCORRECT: This will throw the error
  return NextResponse.redirect('/profile'); 
}
```

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/updateUser.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req) {
  const { name } = await req.json();
  // ... update user logic ...

  const url = new URL('/profile', 'http://localhost:3000'); // Or your production domain
  return NextResponse.redirect(url);
}
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

The corrected code utilizes the `URL` object to construct a complete URL.  We specify the relative path (`/profile`) and the base URL (`http://localhost:3000`).  Replace `http://localhost:3000` with your actual production domain. This provides `NextResponse.redirect` with the absolute URL it expects, resolving the error.

Alternatively you can use `request.url` if you only need to add query parameters to the current URL:

```javascript
// pages/api/updateUser.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req) {
  const { name } = await req.json();
  // ... update user logic ...

  const url = new URL(req.url);
  url.searchParams.append('updated', 'true'); //Append to existing URL.
  return NextResponse.redirect(url);
}
```

This will redirect the user to the same page but append a query parameter. This is useful for situations where you want to remain on the same page but update some state.

## Explanation

The key takeaway is understanding the context in which you're using `NextRouter.push` or `NextResponse.redirect`.  Within client-side components, relative paths are fine.  But when working with server-side functions like API routes and middleware, always construct a fully qualified absolute URL to avoid this error.  Using the `URL` object provides a robust and clear way to achieve this.
