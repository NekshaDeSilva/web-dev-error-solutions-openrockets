# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `404 Not Found` Errors Efficiently


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using Next.js Middleware: properly handling 404 (Not Found) errors and preventing them from crashing the application or leading to unexpected behavior.  Middleware runs before a request is handled by a page or API route, making it a critical point for error handling.  Improperly handling a 404 in middleware can lead to the entire application failing to respond gracefully.


**Description of the Error:**

When using middleware, if a route doesn't exist or if there's an error during the middleware execution that results in an unresolved route, Next.js might throw a 404 error.  If this error isn't caught and handled properly, the user will see a blank page or a generic error message, negatively impacting the user experience.  The error might manifest differently depending on the type of middleware being used (e.g., `next/server` based or `next/middleware` based).


**Step-by-step Code Fix:**

We'll focus on fixing this with `next/server` middleware because it's the modern approach. This approach offers better performance and flexibility.

Let's assume we have middleware that checks for authentication:

**Problematic Middleware (next/server):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }

  // This part is missing error handling. What if accessing a protected route that doesn't exist?
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'] // Protected routes
}
```

**Improved Middleware (next/server):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token')

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }

  try {
    // Attempt to access a protected page.  If the page doesn't exist, a 404 is thrown internally
    const requestedPage = req.nextUrl.pathname; 
    // Add your page validation/existence check here if needed - database lookup or filesystem check 
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error gracefully - return a proper 404 response.
    if(error.message.includes('404')){
      return new NextResponse("Page not found", { status: 404 });
    } else {
        // Log the error for debugging.
        console.error("Middleware Error:", error);
        // Return a generic error response (500) in case of an unexpected error
        return new NextResponse("An unexpected error occurred", { status: 500 });
    }
  }


  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*']
}
```


**Explanation:**

The improved code includes a `try...catch` block. If any error occurs within the `try` block, particularly if a route doesn't exist, the `catch` block catches it.   A check for error messages containing "404" distinguishes a true 404 from other middleware errors. This prevents generic error messages and provides a more informative response to the user. Returning a `NextResponse` with a specific HTTP status code (404 or 500) ensures the client receives a meaningful response.

If you are using `next/middleware` the logic will be almost identical. Just replace `NextResponse` and the handling of requests will be slightly different.
