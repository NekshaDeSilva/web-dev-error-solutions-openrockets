# üêû Dealing with `Error: NextResponse must be used within an async function` in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: NextResponse must be used within an async function`. This error arises when you attempt to use the `NextResponse` object within a synchronous middleware function.  Next.js Middleware functions *must* be asynchronous to handle the inherent asynchronicity of network requests and data fetching.


**Description of the Error:**

The error message clearly states that `NextResponse`, the object used to manipulate the HTTP response in Next.js Middleware, can only be used inside an `async` function.  If you try to use it in a standard (synchronous) function, the runtime will throw this error, preventing your middleware from functioning correctly.


**Full Code of Fixing Step by Step:**

Let's assume you have the following erroneous middleware code:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js (Incorrect)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()
  url.pathname = '/login'
  return NextResponse.redirect(url)
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'],
}
```

This code will produce the error.  Here's the corrected version:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js (Corrected)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function middleware(req) { // Note the 'async' keyword
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()
  url.pathname = '/login'
  return NextResponse.redirect(url)
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/'],
}
```

The only change is adding the `async` keyword before the `middleware` function declaration.  This simple modification makes the function asynchronous, allowing the use of `NextResponse` without errors.


**Explanation:**

The `async` keyword transforms a function into an asynchronous function.  This allows the function to use the `await` keyword, pausing execution until a Promise resolves.  While `NextResponse.redirect()` doesn't explicitly use a Promise in this example, the underlying operations within Next.js Middleware inherently involve asynchronous tasks. By making the function `async`, you ensure compatibility with these internal asynchronous operations, preventing the error.
