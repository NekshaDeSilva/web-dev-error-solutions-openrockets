# üêû Handling `next/font` Issues in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common problem encountered when using the `next/font` package within Next.js Middleware. Specifically, we'll focus on the error that occurs when attempting to use fonts loaded with `next/font` within middleware functions that need to generate responses based on font information.  The core issue stems from the fact that `next/font`'s font loading process is asynchronous and might not be fully completed by the time the middleware function needs to send a response.

**Description of the Error:**

The error isn't always a clear-cut error message. Instead, you might experience unexpected behavior such as:

* **Incorrect font rendering:** The expected font doesn't appear in the generated HTML, resulting in a fallback font being used instead.
* **Middleware function timing issues:** The middleware function might return a response before the font loading is complete, leading to inconsistent behavior or errors.
* **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'family')` or similar:**  This error happens when the code tries to access font properties from `next/font` before the font object is fully initialized.

**Code Example & Step-by-step Fix:**

Let's say we have a middleware function that aims to modify the HTML response based on the user's detected font preference. The initial, flawed approach might look like this:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Font', inter.style.fontFamily); // ERROR PRONE!
  return response;
}
```

This code attempts to access `inter.style.fontFamily` directly. However, `inter` is an asynchronous object that might not be fully populated when this line is executed.

Here's the corrected code, using `async/await` to ensure the font is fully loaded before accessing its properties:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export async function middleware(req) {
  await inter.load(); // Await the font loading
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Font', inter.style.fontFamily);
  return response;
}

```

This fix uses `await inter.load();` to ensure that the font loading process completes before accessing the `inter.style.fontFamily` property.  This eliminates the race condition that leads to the error.


**Explanation:**

The `next/font` package uses asynchronous operations to load fonts.  If you directly access font properties before the loading is finished, you'll run into the problems described earlier. Using `async/await` ensures that the code waits for the font to load completely before proceeding, resolving the timing issue and preventing undefined property accesses.

**Conclusion:**

By understanding the asynchronous nature of `next/font` and employing `async/await`, you can prevent common issues when using fonts within Next.js Middleware.  Remember to always handle asynchronous operations properly to avoid unexpected behavior.
