# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Error: Middleware response must not contain a `body` property`


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: Middleware response must not contain a 'body' property`.  This error arises when attempting to directly send a response body from middleware, which is not supported. Middleware's primary purpose is to modify the request or redirect, not to generate a full response.

## Description of the Error

The error `Error: Middleware response must not contain a 'body' property` signifies that your middleware function is trying to return a response object that includes a `body` property.  Middleware functions should only utilize the `NextResponse` object's methods for redirection (`redirect()`), rewriting URLs (`rewrite()`), or modifying headers.  Attempting to set a body directly will result in this error.

## Code: Problematic and Corrected Examples

**Problematic Code (Incorrect):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from middleware!' }) //INCORRECT
  return res;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about',
}
```

This code attempts to send a JSON response directly from the middleware. This will result in the error.


**Corrected Code (Step-by-Step Fix):**

This example demonstrates redirecting to a different page if the condition is met, handling the situation correctly.  No response body is needed.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  // Simulate checking for a condition. Replace with your actual logic.
  const isAuthenticated = false;

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Redirect to the login page if not authenticated.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  //Otherwise, continue with request.
  return NextResponse.next();

}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about',
}

```

**Corrected Code (Another Example using Headers):**

This example shows how to modify headers within middleware.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.next();
  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value');
  return res;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

This modifies the request's headers.  No body is included.


## Explanation

Next.js Middleware is designed for handling requests *before* they reach your pages or API routes.  Its primary function is to transform requests, not to generate responses.  Therefore, directly adding a `body` to the response object within middleware is invalid and leads to the error.  Middleware should utilize `NextResponse.redirect()`, `NextResponse.rewrite()`, and header manipulation to control request flow.  Full responses are handled within your pages or API routes.
