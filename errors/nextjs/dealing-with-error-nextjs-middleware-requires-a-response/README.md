# üêû Dealing with `Error: NextJS Middleware requires a response`


This document addresses a common error encountered when developing Next.js applications:  `Error: NextJS Middleware requires a response`. This error occurs when a Next.js middleware function doesn't explicitly return a `Response` object, causing the middleware to fail.  Middleware functions *must* return a response to be correctly processed.  Failure to do so leads to this error.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: NextJS Middleware requires a response` error signifies that your middleware function hasn't provided a response object to Next.js. Next.js needs this response to determine how to handle the request (e.g., redirect, modify headers, continue to the next handler).  The error typically happens during runtime and will halt the request processing.


**Code Example (Problem):**

This example shows faulty middleware that will throw the error:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  // Check if the user is authenticated
  const isAuthenticated = req.cookies.isAuthenticated;
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // This is WRONG! It doesn't return a response.
    redirect('/login'); 
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/*'],
}
```

**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Here's how to correctly implement the middleware, ensuring a response is always returned:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const isAuthenticated = req.cookies.isAuthenticated;

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Correct: Returns a Redirect Response
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  // Correct:  Returns a Response if the user is authenticated.
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/*'],
}
```


**Explanation:**

The key change involves using `NextResponse` from `next/server`.  Instead of directly calling `redirect`, we use `NextResponse.redirect()` to create a proper `Response` object that includes a redirect. `NextResponse.next()` is used to allow the request to continue to the next middleware or page handler if the user is authenticated.   Every execution path within the `middleware` function *must* return a `NextResponse` object.  Otherwise, Next.js cannot complete the request processing.

**Summary:**

The `Error: NextJS Middleware requires a response` error highlights a fundamental requirement of Next.js middleware:  it must always return a `NextResponse` object.  This object defines how the middleware responds to the request.  Failure to do so results in the error.  By using `NextResponse.redirect()` for redirects and `NextResponse.next()` to continue processing, you can avoid this common issue.
