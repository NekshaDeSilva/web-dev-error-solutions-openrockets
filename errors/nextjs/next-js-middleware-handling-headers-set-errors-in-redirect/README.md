# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `headers.set` Errors in `redirect`


This document addresses a common error developers encounter when using Next.js Middleware: attempting to set headers after a redirect has been initiated using `nextResponse.redirect`.  The `headers.set` method will not work after a redirect call.  This causes issues when you try to set cookies or other headers which are dependent upon the redirection.


**Description of the Error:**

When you try to set headers using `nextResponse.headers.set()` after calling `nextResponse.redirect()`, you'll likely encounter no visible error, but the headers will simply not be set.  Your intended changes, such as setting a cookie after redirecting a user to a different page, will be ignored.  Debugging this can be tricky, as the console might not show a clear error message.


**Code: Problematic Example**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.next();
  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'some-value');  //this will be ignored
  if (req.cookies.auth_token){
    return res
  } else {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

In this example, the `X-Custom-Header` will only be set if authentication cookie exists. If the cookie isn't present, the redirect happens *before* the header is set rendering it ineffective.


**Code: Step-by-Step Fix**

1. **Conditional Header Setting:** Move the header setting *before* the redirect condition. This ensures the header is set before any redirect occurs.

2. **Early Return:** Ensure an early return if the header is the sole task of the middleware


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const res = NextResponse.next();
  if (req.cookies.auth_token){
      res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'some-value'); // Set header if authenticated
      return res;
  } else {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
}
```

This revised code sets the header only if the authentication cookie exists, which is before the redirect happens.  If redirection is necessary the header will still be set and sent to the client if authentication has been successful.


**Explanation:**

The key is understanding the execution order. `nextResponse.redirect()` immediately terminates the middleware's response. Any code after the redirect call won't be executed, rendering attempts to set headers ineffective. By setting the headers before the redirect condition, you ensure they're applied before the redirection process begins.
