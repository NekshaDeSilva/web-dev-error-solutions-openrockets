# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `NextResponse.rewrite` with Dynamic Routes


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using `NextResponse.rewrite` within Next.js Middleware to redirect requests based on dynamic parameters.  The problem arises when attempting to rewrite to a route that includes those same dynamic parameters, but the rewrite URL isn't properly constructed, leading to incorrect or unexpected redirects.

**Description of the Error:**

Let's say you want to rewrite requests to `/product/[id]` based on a specific condition within your middleware.  A common mistake is to directly use the incoming request's `params` object within `NextResponse.rewrite`. This often results in a `404 Not Found` error because the dynamic segment isn't correctly interpreted by the rewrite function.  The middleware's `params` object might not be directly compatible with the `NextResponse.rewrite` URL construction.

**Code (Illustrating the Problem):**

```javascript
// middleware.js (INCORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const { params } = req;

  if (params?.id === 'special-product') {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/product/${params.id}`, req.url)); // Incorrect usage!
  }

  return NextResponse;
}
```

This code attempts to rewrite `/product/special-product` to itself.  However, it may not function correctly due to how `NextResponse.rewrite` handles dynamic segments.


**Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step:**

1. **Correctly Construct the Rewrite URL:** Instead of directly using `req.url` to create a new `URL`, construct the rewrite URL string manually, ensuring correct formatting for dynamic segments:

2. **Use `req.nextUrl` for better results:** Instead of manipulating the `req.url` directly, use `req.nextUrl` which provides better manipulation capabilities within the Next.js context.


```javascript
// middleware.js (CORRECT)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const { params } = req;

  if (params?.id === 'special-product') {
      const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
      url.pathname = `/product/special-product`; //Directly setting pathname for clarity
      return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}


```

This revised code directly sets the pathname of the `req.nextUrl` to the correct path, resolving any issues related to dynamic segments in the rewrite URL. Using `req.nextUrl.clone()` allows safe modification of the URL without affecting other properties.


**Explanation:**

The original code's error stems from the way `NextResponse.rewrite` interprets dynamic segments. By manually constructing the URL string with the correct path (`/product/special-product`), we bypass potential conflicts and ensure a successful redirect.  Using `req.nextUrl` instead of constructing a URL from scratch offers additional benefit of inheriting properties like search parameters and ensuring proper URL construction within the context of the Next.js environment.
