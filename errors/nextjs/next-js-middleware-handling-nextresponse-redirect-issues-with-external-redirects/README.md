# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `NextResponse.redirect` Issues with External Redirects


This document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using `NextResponse.redirect` within Next.js Middleware:  redirects to external domains not working as expected.  This often manifests as a redirect loop or the redirect simply not functioning correctly.

**Description of the Error:**

When you try to redirect to an external URL using `NextResponse.redirect` in your middleware, the redirect might fail or lead to an infinite redirect loop.  This is because Next.js middleware is designed primarily for internal route manipulation and expects a `NextResponse` object with a destination within the Next.js application.  Redirecting to external domains requires careful handling.

**Code Example (Problematic):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();

  if (url.pathname === '/') {
    url.pathname = 'https://www.example.com'; // Incorrect - external redirect
    return NextResponse.redirect(url);
  }
}
```

This code attempts to redirect to `https://www.example.com`, which will likely fail or cause a redirect loop.

**Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step:**

1. **Use `NextResponse.rewrite` instead of `NextResponse.redirect` for external URLs:** This is the key to avoiding issues.  `NextResponse.rewrite` performs a server-side rewrite of the request URL, effectively changing the user's view without a redirect in the browser's history.

2. **Ensure proper URL handling:**  Use the full, correctly formatted URL.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();

  if (url.pathname === '/') {
    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('https://www.example.com', req.url));
  }
}

```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code uses `NextResponse.rewrite` to replace the incoming request URL with the external URL. The `new URL('https://www.example.com', req.url)` part is crucial. It constructs a new URL object using the base URL from the original request (`req.url`) to ensure the absolute path is correctly generated, resolving any potential relative path issues.  This avoids unexpected behavior and ensures the redirection functions correctly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:**  Be mindful of security implications when redirecting users to external domains.  Validate external URLs before redirecting to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **User Experience:**  Consider the user experience. An external redirect might break the user's expected flow and should be implemented thoughtfully.
