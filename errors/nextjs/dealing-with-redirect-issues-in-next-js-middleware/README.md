# üêû Dealing with `Redirect` Issues in Next.js Middleware


Next.js Middleware offers powerful capabilities for manipulating requests before they reach your pages, but improper use of redirects can lead to unexpected behavior. This document addresses a common issue: infinite redirect loops caused by incorrectly configuring middleware redirects.

## Description of the Error

The error manifests as an unending series of redirects, resulting in a browser error ("ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS") or a never-ending loading spinner. This typically happens when your middleware redirects to a location that triggers the middleware again, creating a cyclical redirect chain. This is often seen when trying to redirect based on a condition that remains true after the initial redirect.


## Code Example and Step-by-Step Fix

Let's consider a scenario where we want to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page, but our middleware inadvertently creates an infinite loop.

**Problematic Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const session = req.cookies.get('session')

  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
}
```

This middleware attempts to redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.  However, if `/login` also triggers this middleware (because the `matcher` includes it), and the user isn't logged in there either, the redirect will loop indefinitely.


**Step 1: Refine the `matcher`:**

The key to resolving this is carefully controlling which paths the middleware affects using the `matcher` property in the `config` object.  To prevent the middleware from processing `/login`, we modify the matcher:

```javascript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|/login).*)'],
}
```

This updated `matcher` specifically excludes `/login` from the middleware's processing.  The `matcher` now only applies to paths that *don't* include `/login`.


**Step 2:  Consider alternative approaches (If needed):**

Sometimes, a simple matcher adjustment isn't enough.  For more complex scenarios, you might consider:

* **Using a flag or session variable:** Set a session variable after successful login. The middleware checks for this variable instead of directly relying on the cookie.
* **Separate Middleware for specific paths:** Create different middleware functions for different routes to handle redirection logic more granularly. This avoids unintended side effects from overly broad matchers.

**Corrected Middleware:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const session = req.cookies.get('session')

  if (!session) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|/login).*)'],
}
```


## Explanation

The infinite redirect loop arises from a mismatch between the intended behavior and the middleware's scope.  The original `matcher` was too broad, causing the middleware to repeatedly apply its redirect logic, even after the initial redirect to `/login`.  By excluding `/login` from the `matcher`, we break the cycle, ensuring the redirect happens only once.
