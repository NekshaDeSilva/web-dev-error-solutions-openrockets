# üêû Next.js API Routes: Handling Asynchronous Operations and Promises


This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with asynchronous operations within Next.js API routes:  returning a Promise that isn't properly handled, leading to unexpected errors or incomplete responses.


## Description of the Error

When an API route relies on asynchronous operations (like fetching data from a database or external API), you must ensure that the Promise returned by the asynchronous function is handled correctly before sending a response.  Failing to do so often results in a blank response, a timeout error, or an internal server error (500).  The server might not wait for the asynchronous operation to complete before closing the connection, leading to an incomplete response.

## Code: Step-by-Step Fix

Let's illustrate this with an example API route that fetches data from an external API:

**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/data.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data; // Incorrect: Returns a Promise, not a response
}
```

This code is flawed because `return data;`  doesn't explicitly send the data back to the client as a response.  The `data` variable is resolved with the json, however, the response is not sent. The server will close the connection before the promise resolves.

**Corrected Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/data.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();

    // Correctly send the data as a JSON response
    res.status(200).json(data); 
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });
  }
}
```

This corrected version explicitly uses `res.status(200).json(data)` to send the fetched data as a JSON response with a 200 OK status code.  The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during the fetch and sends an appropriate error response (500 Internal Server Error).


## Explanation

The key difference lies in how the response is handled.  The problematic code implicitly attempts to return a Promise, which Next.js's API route handler doesn't interpret correctly.  The corrected code utilizes the `res` object provided by the Next.js API route handler to explicitly send a response to the client, making sure that the data is sent *after* the asynchronous operation has completed.  The use of `try...catch` is crucial for robust error handling, preventing unexpected crashes.
