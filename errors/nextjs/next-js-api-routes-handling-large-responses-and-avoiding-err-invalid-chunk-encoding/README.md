# üêû Next.js API Routes: Handling Large Responses and Avoiding `ERR_INVALID_CHUNK_ENCODING`


This document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js API routes: the `ERR_INVALID_CHUNK_ENCODING` error, often triggered by attempting to send very large responses from an API route.  This usually manifests in the browser as a network error, and the response never reaches the client.


**Description of the Error:**

The `ERR_INVALID_CHUNK_ENCODING` error typically arises when a large response from your Next.js API route is improperly chunked or exceeds the browser's capacity to handle a single request.  This is particularly problematic with files, images, or large datasets.  The browser struggles to process the incomplete or incorrectly formatted chunks of data it receives.


**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's assume we have an API route (`pages/api/largedata.js`) that attempts to send a large JSON file:

**Problematic Code (pages/api/largedata.js):**

```javascript
// pages/api/largedata.js
import largeData from '../../data/largedata.json';

export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json(largeData); 
}
```

This code might work for small datasets, but fails for large `largedata.json`.  The fix involves streaming the response instead of sending the entire JSON at once.  We'll use the `ReadableStream` from the Node.js `stream` module.

**Corrected Code (pages/api/largedata.js):**


```javascript
// pages/api/largedata.js
import { pipeline } from 'stream/promises';
import fs from 'fs';
import { Readable } from 'stream';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const filePath = '../../data/largedata.json';

  try {
      const readStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
      await pipeline(readStream, res);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error streaming data:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to send data' });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary modules:** We import `pipeline` for efficient stream handling, `fs` for file system access, and `Readable` (though not directly used in this example, it is useful to know for more complex scenarios.)
2. **Create Readable Stream:** `fs.createReadStream(filePath)` creates a readable stream from the JSON file. This allows data to be sent in smaller chunks.
3. **Set Response Headers:** `res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })` sets the appropriate HTTP status code and content type.  This is crucial for the client to correctly interpret the response.
4. **Use pipeline:** `await pipeline(readStream, res)` pipes the data from the readable stream to the response.  This handles the chunking efficiently and avoids memory issues. The `await` keyword ensures that the entire pipeline completes before the function returns.
5. **Error Handling:**  The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during file reading or streaming, preventing the server from crashing and providing a more graceful response to the client.
