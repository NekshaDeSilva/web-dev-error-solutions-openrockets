# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Request Not Found` Errors


This document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Request Not Found` error. This error typically occurs when middleware attempts to access a route that doesn't exist, leading to a failed request.  It's particularly problematic because it can be difficult to debug, especially when middleware is involved in complex routing scenarios.

## Description of the Error

The `Request Not Found` error in Next.js middleware manifests as a 404 error in the browser or a similar error in your logs. It indicates that the middleware function tried to access a route (often implicitly through `next.nextUrl.pathname`) that wasn't found by the Next.js router.  This often happens because of typos in the path, incorrect usage of wildcards (`*`), or issues with the overall routing configuration of your application.  The error message itself may not always be very specific, making debugging challenging.

## Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Code Example

Let's assume you have middleware that attempts to redirect users based on a path, but contains a typo:

**Problematic Middleware (`middleware.js`):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  if (url.pathname === '/profle') { // Typo: 'profle' instead of 'profile'
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profle', '/profile', '/login'], // Note: This incorrectly includes 'profle'
}
```

This code will cause a `Request Not Found` error if a user attempts to access `/profle`.

**Corrected Middleware (`middleware.js`):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  if (url.pathname === '/profile') {  // Corrected typo
    const isLoggedIn = checkIfLoggedIn(req); // Placeholder for authentication check
    if (!isLoggedIn) {
      url.pathname = '/login';
      return NextResponse.redirect(url); // Use redirect for better UX
    }
  }
}

// Placeholder for authentication logic
function checkIfLoggedIn(req) {
    // Add your authentication logic here, e.g., checking for a session cookie.
    return false; // Example: Not logged in initially
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile', '/login'], // Removed incorrect path
}
```

This corrected version fixes the typo in the pathname and removes the incorrect entry from the `matcher` array.  It also demonstrates best practice by using `NextResponse.redirect()` instead of `NextResponse.rewrite()`, leading to a better user experience.  A placeholder for authentication logic is included to demonstrate a more realistic scenario.


## Explanation

The `Request Not Found` error is solved by carefully examining the paths used in the middleware's `matcher` and the path comparisons within the middleware function itself.  Double-check for typos, ensure the wildcard character (`*`) is used correctly if necessary, and make sure the paths match the actual routes in your application.  Using `console.log(req.nextUrl.pathname)` within your middleware can be helpful for debugging path issues. Additionally, using  `NextResponse.redirect()` for user-facing redirects is generally preferred over `NextResponse.rewrite()`.
