# üêû Next.js Middleware: Handling `Error: Headers have already been sent`


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware:  `Error: Headers have already been sent`.  This error typically occurs when you attempt to send headers to the client multiple times within a single middleware function.  This is often because the middleware unintentionally sends data, or other middleware/APIs has already sent the response.


**Description of the Error:**

The `Error: Headers have already been sent` indicates that your Next.js middleware function has already committed a response to the client (sent headers), and is attempting to modify or send additional headers subsequently.  HTTP/1.1 protocol only allows a single response to be sent.  Once headers are sent, any further attempts to modify them will result in this error.


**Scenario:**  Let's imagine you're building authentication middleware. You might inadvertently send a response (e.g., a redirect) and then try to set additional headers later in the middleware function.

**Problematic Code Example:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  if (!req.cookies.token) {
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.redirect(url); //This sends a response
  }

  //This will cause the error "Headers have already been sent"
  req.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');  
  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/protected/:path*'
}
```

**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Identify the source:** Carefully review your middleware function. Look for any instances where you might be sending a response (e.g., `NextResponse.redirect`, `NextResponse.json`, `NextResponse.rewrite`) *before* you attempt to set headers.

2. **Conditional Logic:**  Use conditional statements to ensure headers are only set *before* a response is sent.  This is usually best practice for handling headers or rewriting before redirecting.  If you need to set headers based on different conditions in your Middleware, you might need to refactor your conditional statements to check for both scenarios properly.

3. **Refactored Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();
  if (!req.cookies.token) {
    url.pathname = '/login';
    return NextResponse.redirect(url); 
  }

  const res = NextResponse.next();
  res.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Setting headers before returning response
  return res;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/protected/:path*'
}
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code ensures that the headers are set on the `NextResponse` object *before* it's returned. This prevents the middleware from attempting to modify headers after a response has already been committed.  The key is to set the headers on the `res` object before you return it.

**Conclusion:**

The `Error: Headers have already been sent` in Next.js Middleware is almost always caused by sending a response (e.g., redirect) *after* you've already attempted to set headers. By carefully structuring your code to set headers only *before* sending any response, you can avoid this common issue.
