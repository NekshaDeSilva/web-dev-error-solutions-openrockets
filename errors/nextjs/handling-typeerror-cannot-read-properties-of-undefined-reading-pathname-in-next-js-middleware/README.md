# üêû Handling "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')" in Next.js Middleware


This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')"`. This error typically arises when accessing the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property within middleware before it's properly defined.  This often happens due to incorrect middleware placement or attempting to access properties before the request is fully processed.


## Description of the Error

The error message `"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')"` signifies that the `req.nextUrl` object, specifically its `pathname` property, is undefined when your middleware attempts to access it.  This prevents your middleware from correctly interpreting the URL and executing its intended logic.


## Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix

Let's assume we have middleware that tries to redirect requests based on the pathname:

**Problematic Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
export function middleware(req) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-page') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-page', req.url))
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-page'],
};
```

This code will throw the error because `req.nextUrl` might not be fully populated when the middleware function first executes.

**Corrected Code (middleware.js):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Create a clone to avoid modifying the original request

  if (url.pathname === '/old-page') {
    url.pathname = '/new-page'; // Modify the pathname of the cloned URL
    return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Use rewrite instead of redirect for better caching
  }

  return NextResponse.next(); // Ensure a response is always returned
}


export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-page'],
};
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Import `NextResponse`:**  We explicitly import `NextResponse` to ensure proper access to the necessary functions for redirecting or rewriting responses.
2. **Clone `req.nextUrl`:** We create a clone of `req.nextUrl` using the `.clone()` method. This is crucial. Modifying the original `req.nextUrl` can lead to unexpected behaviour.  We operate on the clone, leaving the original request untouched.
3. **Use `url.pathname`:** We now access the pathname from the cloned `url` object, guaranteeing it's defined.
4. **`NextResponse.rewrite`:** We've switched from `NextResponse.redirect` to `NextResponse.rewrite`. This is generally preferred for better caching behavior, especially when handling internal URL changes.
5. **`NextResponse.next()`:**  This line is crucial.  It ensures that if the condition (`url.pathname === '/old-page'`) is false, the middleware still returns a response.  Failing to return a response can lead to unexpected errors.

## Explanation

The core issue is the asynchronous nature of the request handling within Next.js Middleware.  The `req.nextUrl` object is populated as part of the request processing pipeline. If you try to access it too early, before the pipeline has completed populating it, you'll encounter the `undefined` error. Cloning `req.nextUrl` allows you to work with a copy that you're guaranteed to be able to modify without interfering with the overall request handling.  Always ensure your middleware functions return a `NextResponse` object, regardless of the conditions within your logic.
