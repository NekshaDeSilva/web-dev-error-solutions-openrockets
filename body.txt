## Description of the Error

A common issue encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is a failure to render the chart correctly.  The chart might appear blank, display incompletely, or throw rendering errors in the browser's developer console. This is often due to IE11's limited support for certain HTML5 canvas features or discrepancies in how it interprets JavaScript code compared to modern browsers.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This solution focuses on using a polyfill to address potential compatibility gaps in IE11.  We'll use `excanvas` as an example, although other polyfills may also work.

**Step 1: Include the excanvas library**

First, you need to include the excanvas library in your HTML file. You can download it from various sources online (search for "excanvas download").  Make sure to place the `excanvas.js` file in your project's JavaScript directory. Then, add the script tag to your HTML file *before* your CanvasJS script inclusion.


```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
<script src="excanvas.js"></script>  <!-- Include excanvas before CanvasJS -->
<script src="canvasjs.min.js"></script>  <!-- Your CanvasJS library -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.onload = function () {
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
      // Your chart configuration here...
      title:{
        text: "My Chart"
      },
      data: [
      {
        type: "column",
        dataPoints: [
          { x: 10, y: 71 },
          { x: 20, y: 55},
          { x: 30, y: 50 },
          { x: 40, y: 65 }
        ]
      }
      ]
    });
    chart.render();
  }
</script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
</body>
</html>
```


**Step 2:  (Optional) Conditional Loading:**

For better performance in modern browsers that don't require `excanvas`, you can conditionally load it:

```javascript
if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') !== -1 || navigator.appVersion.indexOf('Trident/') > 0) {
  document.write('<script src="excanvas.js"></script>');
}
```

This code snippet checks the user agent to see if it's IE and only includes `excanvas` if necessary. Place this code *before* including your CanvasJS script.

**Step 3:  Ensure Correct Chart Configuration:**

Double-check that your CanvasJS chart configuration is correct and doesn't contain any errors.  Refer to the CanvasJS documentation for proper syntax and usage.

## Explanation

IE11's limitations with the HTML5 canvas element can lead to rendering problems.  `excanvas` is a JavaScript library that provides a shim or polyfill, emulating the canvas API in older browsers that lack full support. By including `excanvas`, we essentially provide IE11 with a compatible version of the canvas functionality necessary for CanvasJS to function properly.  Conditional loading helps to avoid unnecessary overhead in modern browsers.
