## Description of the Error

A common performance issue in MongoDB arises from having too many indexes.  While indexes speed up queries, an excessive number can significantly hinder write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) and increase storage overhead.  This is because every write operation requires updating all affected indexes, leading to slower write performance and increased storage consumption.  The symptoms often include sluggish write performance, increased latency, and potentially even exceeding storage limits.  MongoDB may not explicitly throw an error, but the performance degradation is a clear indicator.


## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes on a collection called `products`.  Assume you have a MongoDB instance running and a collection `products` with several indexes.


**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we need to list all existing indexes on the `products` collection.  We use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array detailing all indexes on the `products` collection, including their keys and other metadata.  Examine the output carefully to understand which indexes exist and their usage.


**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

MongoDB provides tools to analyze index usage.  The most common approach is to utilize the `db.collection.stats()` method which provides detailed statistics about a collection, including information related to index usage.  We can then identify indexes with low usage by comparing `accesses` to total number of operations.  Low values for `accesses` on an index are a candidate for removal.

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

After identifying underutilized or redundant indexes (e.g., indexes covering the same fields with different sorting orders that aren't significantly improving query times), you can remove them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method.  For instance, to remove an index named `_id_1`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("_id_1")
```

Or, to drop an index based on a specific key:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { "productName": 1, "price": -1 } )
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor the write performance of your application.  Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or your application's logging to track write times and observe if the performance improves.


## Explanation

The "Too Many Indexes" problem is a classic case of optimization gone wrong.  While indexes dramatically speed up read operations by allowing MongoDB to avoid full collection scans, the overhead they introduce during write operations becomes significant when their number increases excessively.  Indexes need to be carefully chosen and maintained.  Focusing on frequently queried fields and eliminating redundant or underutilized indexes is crucial for maintaining optimal performance.
