## Description of the Error

The "Too Many Open Cursors" error in MongoDB arises when a client application holds onto database cursors for an extended period without closing them. This typically happens when loops iterate through large datasets, fetching documents one by one without properly releasing the cursor resources.  MongoDB has a limit on the number of open cursors per connection, and exceeding this limit leads to the error, preventing further database operations.  This can severely impact application performance and availability.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix (Python Example)

This example demonstrates how to avoid the "Too Many Open Cursors" error using Python's `pymongo` driver.  We'll focus on correctly handling cursors when iterating through a large collection.

**Incorrect Code (Leads to the Error):**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

for doc in collection.find({}):  # Incorrect: Keeps cursor open for entire loop
    # Process each document
    print(doc)

client.close()
```

**Corrected Code:**

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

try:
    cursor = collection.find({}) #Get the cursor
    for doc in cursor:
        # Process each document
        print(doc)
    cursor.close() #Explicitly close the cursor
except pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError as e:
    print(f"Server Selection Timeout Error: {e}")
except pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure as e:
    print(f"Connection Failure: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    client.close() #Always ensure to close the client at the end

```

**Explanation of Correction:**

1. **Explicit Cursor Closing:** The crucial change is adding `cursor.close()` after the loop. This explicitly releases the cursor resources back to the MongoDB server.

2. **Error Handling:** The `try...except...finally` block ensures that the client connection is closed (`client.close()`) even if errors occur during processing. This is good practice for robust code.


## Explanation

The core issue is resource management.  Each cursor consumes resources on both the client and server.  Without explicit closing, the client accumulates many open cursors, eventually exhausting the server's limit.  The `cursor.close()` call is essential for releasing these resources promptly and preventing the error.

The efficient way to process large datasets is typically to fetch documents in batches using the `batch_size` parameter of the `find()` method:

```python
cursor = collection.find({}, batch_size=1000) #Fetch in batches of 1000
for doc in cursor:
  #Process the document
  print(doc)
cursor.close()
```

This reduces the number of open cursors at any given time, improving both performance and preventing the error more effectively than processing one document at a time.
