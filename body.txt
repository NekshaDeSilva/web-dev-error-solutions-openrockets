This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using `NextResponse.redirect` within Next.js Middleware:  correctly preserving query parameters during redirection.  Incorrectly handling these parameters can lead to unexpected behavior and broken functionality in your application.

**Description of the Error:**

When redirecting users from middleware using `NextResponse.redirect`, simply passing the original URL often fails to preserve query parameters.  This results in the redirected page losing crucial contextual information passed through the URL.  For example, if a user navigates to `/products?category=electronics`, a redirect that doesn't preserve the `category` parameter will land them on the target page without filtering by electronics.

**Code: Step-by-Step Fix**

Let's say we have middleware that redirects all requests to `/products` to `/shop` while retaining any query parameters.  Here's how to correctly handle it:

**Incorrect Approach (Loses Query Parameters):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/products') {
    url.pathname = '/shop'
    return NextResponse.redirect(url)
  }
}
```

**Corrected Approach (Preserves Query Parameters):**

```javascript
// middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/products') {
    url.pathname = '/shop'
    // Preserves query parameters
    return NextResponse.redirect(url)
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/products', // Only match /products
}

```

The correction doesn't involve any explicit code change within the `middleware` function itself  because the `.clone()` method already handles query parameters by default. The critical point is to use `req.nextUrl.clone()` to create a new URL object, which automatically inherits the query parameters from the original request.  The `matcher` config ensures that the middleware only applies to the `/products` route, preventing unintended redirects.


**Explanation:**

The `req.nextUrl` object represents the incoming URL.  Directly manipulating it can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `clone()` method creates a copy, allowing modifications without affecting the original object. When `NextResponse.redirect` is called with the cloned URL, all the original query parameters are automatically included in the redirection.

**Conclusion:**

Using `req.nextUrl.clone()` is crucial for correctly handling query parameters within Next.js Middleware redirects.  This simple step prevents data loss and ensures a smooth user experience.  Always remember to utilize cloning techniques when manipulating URLs to avoid unexpected behavior.
