This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands vertically to reveal more content when hovered over, utilizing transitions for a smooth animation. This example uses plain CSS3, but similar effects can easily be adapted for frameworks like Tailwind CSS.


## Description of the Styling

The card employs a simple layout: a container with an image at the top and text below.  On hover, the height of the container increases, revealing hidden text.  A subtle shadow effect is added to enhance the visual appeal.  The transition property smoothly animates the height change.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 300px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  height: 150px; /* Height when hovered */
}

.card-text {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Card Image">
  <div class="card-content">
    <p class="card-text">This is some example text that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  You can add as much text as you like here and it will smoothly expand the card to accommodate it.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>

```


## Explanation

* **`overflow: hidden;`**:  This property is crucial.  It initially hides the content of both the `.card` and `.card-content` divs.  Without it, the hidden content would still take up space, and the transition wouldn't work correctly.
* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This property specifies that the `height` property should transition smoothly over 0.3 seconds using an `ease-in-out` timing function.  Adjust the duration and timing function to your preference.
* **`:hover .card-content { height: 150px; }`**: This is the core of the expanding effect.  On hover, the `height` of the `.card-content` div changes, revealing the hidden text. Adjust `150px` to control the expanded height.  You could also use `max-height` if you want the content to expand naturally to fill available space within the limits.
