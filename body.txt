This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required!  This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to smoothly expand a card when the user's mouse hovers over it.  We'll use plain CSS for simplicity, but the concept can easily be adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a base state with a certain width and height. Upon hovering, the card will smoothly expand to a larger width and height.  We'll also add a subtle shadow for visual enhancement.  The transition will be applied to the `transform` property (for scaling) and the `box-shadow` property for a more polished effect.


**Full Code:**

```css
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content overflow during expansion */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand by 10% */
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

**HTML Structure (Example):**

To use the CSS, you'll need some basic HTML:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Card Title</h2>
    <p>Some card content goes here.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class defines the base styles for the card, including its size, background color, border radius, and initial box shadow.  The `transition` property is crucial; it specifies that the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties should smoothly transition over 0.3 seconds when their values change.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from spilling outside the card during expansion.
* **`.card:hover`:** This pseudo-class applies styles *only* when the mouse hovers over the element with the class `.card`. The `transform: scale(1.1);` increases the card's size by 10% in both dimensions. The `box-shadow` is also increased to create a more pronounced shadow effect.
