This document details how to create a circular progress bar using only CSS. No JavaScript or image assets are required.  This utilizes the `clip-path` property for a clean and efficient solution.

**Description:**

This styling creates a visually appealing circular progress bar that can be easily customized by changing the percentage value and colors. The progress bar is a single element styled entirely with CSS, making it lightweight and performant.  It works by using a circle as a base and then using the `clip-path` property to "clip" the circle, creating the progress effect.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Circular Progress Bar</title>
<style>
.progress-ring {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */
  position: relative;
}

.progress-ring::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green progress color */
  clip-path: circle(50% at 50% 50%); /* Initial clip path */
  animation: progress-animation 2s linear forwards; /* Animation */
}

@keyframes progress-animation {
  to {
    clip-path: circle(75% at 50% 50%); /* Final clip path (75% complete) */
  }
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Circular Progress Bar</h1>
<div class="progress-ring"></div>


</body>
</html>
```

To change the percentage completion, modify the `circle()` value in the `@keyframes` section and adjust the animation duration as needed. For example, to show 30% completion, change `circle(75% at 50% 50%)` to `circle(30% at 50% 50%)`.  You can also customize the colors by changing the `background-color` properties.


**Explanation:**

1. **Base Circle:** The `.progress-ring` div creates the base circle with a light gray background.
2. **Pseudo-element:** The `::before` pseudo-element creates the progress indicator on top of the base circle.
3. **`clip-path`:**  The `clip-path: circle()` property is key. It creates a circular clipping region. The first `circle()` value defines the starting point, while the `@keyframes` animation modifies it to show the progress.
4. **Animation:** The `progress-animation` keyframes smoothly change the `clip-path` radius, giving the progress effect.  `linear` ensures consistent speed, and `forwards` keeps the final state after animation.
5. **Customization:**  The percentage completed, colors and animation duration can be easily adjusted in the CSS.
