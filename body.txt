This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when manipulating headers within Next.js Middleware: unexpected behavior or errors when attempting to modify the `headers` object directly.  The problem often stems from misunderstanding the asynchronous nature of Middleware and how changes to the `headers` object propagate.


**Description of the Error:**

You might encounter unexpected behavior or errors when trying to directly modify the `headers` object within your middleware function.  For instance, setting a header might not take effect, or you might receive an error indicating the object is read-only or that a certain header cannot be modified.  This is often due to attempting to modify the headers *after* the response has already started being sent.

**Example Scenario:**  Let's say you're trying to add a custom header for security purposes:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
export function middleware(req, res) {
  // Incorrect approach - likely to cause issues
  res.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'MyValue';
  return NextResponse.next(); 
}
```

This approach frequently fails because `res.headers` is not directly mutable in the way you might expect.  Next.js manages the header manipulation internally for efficiency and consistency.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

The correct way to manipulate headers is to use the `NextResponse` object's `headers` method:


```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'MyValue'); // Correct approach
  return response;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The `NextResponse` object provides a clean and consistent way to interact with the response, including headers.  Instead of trying to directly modify a potentially immutable `res.headers` object, you create a `NextResponse` instance (using `NextResponse.next()` to indicate continuation to the next handler) and then use its `.headers.set()` method to add or modify headers.  This ensures the headers are properly handled by Next.js's internal mechanisms and avoids potential conflicts or errors.

**Further Considerations:**

* **Header Case Sensitivity:** Header names are case-insensitive.  `'X-Custom-Header'` is equivalent to `'x-custom-header'`.
* **Header Conflicts:** If you try to set a header that is already set, the later call will override the earlier one.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure all header manipulations occur before the `NextResponse` is returned.  Any asynchronous operations within the middleware must be awaited before setting headers to avoid race conditions.
