This document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required.  The effect involves a card that expands to reveal more content when clicked.  We'll use plain CSS (no frameworks like Tailwind).

**Description of the Styling:**

The styling relies on transitions, transforms, and the `:target` pseudo-class. The card is initially collapsed. Upon clicking, a hidden anchor link within the card is targeted, triggering a CSS transition that expands the card.  The expansion is achieved by scaling the card content and smoothly changing its height.  The styling uses clean, semantic CSS for better maintainability.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 300px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: height 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height changes */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for transform */
  transform-origin: top; /* Ensures scaling happens from the top */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height of the collapsed card */
  overflow: hidden;
}


.card a {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color:inherit;
}

.card-content.expanded {
  height: auto; /* Expands the height to accommodate the content */
  transform: scaleY(1); /* Scales the content up to fill the expanded height */
}


.card:target .card-content {
  height: auto;
  transform: scaleY(1);
  transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out;
  overflow: visible; /* Ensures content is fully visible when expanded */
}

.card:target .expand-button {
    display:none;
}

.card:target {
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <a href="#card-content">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Card Title</h2>
    <p>This is some sample text for the card.  This text will be hidden until the card is expanded.</p>
    <p>More sample text...</p>
  </div>
  </a>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`.card`**:  This class styles the overall card container, setting its width, border, and applying a transition for smooth height changes.  `overflow: hidden` initially hides content exceeding the initial height.
*   **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content within the card.  Transitions are added for smooth transform changes. `transform-origin: top;` ensures scaling happens from the top, creating a cleaner expansion effect.  `height: 100px;` sets the initial height.
*   **`.card-content.expanded`**: This class will be applied when the card is expanded.  It sets the `height: auto;` and the transform for the expand effect.
*   **:target**: This pseudo-class targets the element with the ID specified in the `href` attribute of the anchor. When the link is clicked, the `.card-content` will have the `height` and `transform` property changed.
* **`.card:target .card-content`**: Adding this specific selector ensures that only when card is targetted we get the full expand effect and transitions.
