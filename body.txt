This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect involves a card that expands to reveal more content when hovered over, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.  We'll leverage CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card uses a simple design with a background color and padding. The key to the expanding effect lies in the use of CSS transitions on the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties. On hover, the card scales up slightly, creating an expanding animation.  Simultaneously, a subtle box shadow appears, adding depth and highlighting the interaction.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */
  width: 300px;
  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate interactivity */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand on hover */
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Add a shadow on hover */
}

.card-content {
  /*Content Styling*/
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

.card h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is a simple card that expands on hover, showcasing a CSS-only animation effect.  No JavaScript required!</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial. It defines the transition properties for `transform` and `box-shadow`.  `0.3s` sets the duration of the transition, and `ease-in-out` specifies the timing function, creating a smooth animation.

* **`transform: scale(1.05);`**: This line, within the `:hover` pseudo-class, scales the card up by 5% on hover, creating the expanding effect.

* **`box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`**: This line adds a box shadow to the card on hover, giving it more depth and visual feedback.  The `rgba` value allows you to control the shadow's opacity.
