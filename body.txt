This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that expands vertically to reveal additional content when hovered over.  A subtle shadow effect enhances the visual appeal.  This example uses plain CSS3, but the concepts could easily be adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

## Description of the Styling

The styling leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve the expansion effect.  The card's height transitions smoothly from a compact size to a larger size upon hover.  A box-shadow is added to create a subtle, three-dimensional effect that intensifies on hover.  The internal content is initially hidden, then revealed via a height transition.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Subtle lift on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: height 0.5s ease; /* Smooth height transition */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  height: 200px; /* Expanded height */
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-text {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p class="card-text">This is some example text to demonstrate the expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when you hover over it, revealing more content.  No JavaScript is needed!</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Explanation

* **`transition` property:**  This property is crucial for creating the smooth animation. It specifies which CSS properties should transition and how (duration, timing function).  We apply it to `box-shadow`, `transform` (for the lift on hover) and the `height` of the `.card-content`.
* **`height` property:** The `.card-content` initially has a smaller height. On hover, this height is increased, revealing the hidden text.  The `overflow: hidden;` prevents the content from overflowing before expansion.
* **`box-shadow` property:** This creates the subtle shadow effect, which is enhanced on hover.
* **`transform: translateY(-2px);`:** This creates a subtle lifting effect on hover, adding depth to the animation.
