This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required!  This example uses plain CSS3, but the concepts could easily be adapted to a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

This effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over. The expansion reveals hidden content within the card.  The animation is smooth and uses pure CSS transitions.  We achieve this primarily using the `height` property and transitions, along with some clever use of overflow to initially hide the content.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Initially hides the expanded content */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  height: auto; /* Allows the card to expand to its content's height */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 1.2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-text {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

.initially-hidden {
  height: 0; /* Initially hides this section */
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing while hidden */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card:hover .initially-hidden {
  height: auto; /* Shows the content on hover */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p class="card-text">This is some example text for the card.  It will expand when you hover over the card.</p>
    <div class="initially-hidden">
      <p class="card-text">This paragraph is initially hidden and will only be revealed on hover.  You can add as much content as you like here.</p>
      <p class="card-text">This is another paragraph of hidden content.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is crucial. It initially hides the extra content of the `initially-hidden` div, preventing it from affecting the card's initial height.
* **`transition: height 0.3s ease;`:** This creates a smooth animation when the height of the card changes.  The `ease` timing function provides a comfortable transition.
* **`.card:hover { height: auto; }`:** On hover, the card's height is set to `auto`, allowing it to dynamically adjust to the content's height, including the now-visible hidden section.
* **`.initially-hidden` and `.card:hover .initially-hidden`:** These selectors work in tandem to control the visibility of the extra content.
