This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required!  The effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll use pure CSS3 to achieve this.

**Description of the Styling:**

The styling utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to create the smooth expanding animation. The card's height is initially set to a smaller value. On hover, the height is transitioned to a larger value, revealing hidden content within.  We use `overflow: hidden` to keep the hidden content concealed until the card expands.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is some extra content that is revealed when you hover over the card.</p>
    <p>You can add as much content as you want here.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial for hiding the content that extends beyond the initial height.  The `transition` property defines a smooth animation for the height change on hover.

* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles when the card is hovered over.  The `height` is increased to reveal the hidden content.

* **`.card-content` & `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and presentation.
