This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll use pure CSS3 for this, avoiding JavaScript entirely.


**Description of the Styling:**

This effect relies primarily on the CSS `max-height` property and transitions.  The card starts with a limited `max-height`, visually restricting its content. On hover, the `max-height` is changed to allow the content to fully expand, and the transition property smoothly animates this change.  We also use some basic styling for visual appeal.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows the max-height */
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  max-height: 400px; /* Height when hovered */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
    <p>This is some sample text for the card.  This content will be hidden initially and will expand on hover.</p>
    <p>More text to demonstrate the expansion.  Add as much text as you need to see the effect clearly.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent the content from overflowing before the expansion. The `transition` property is what enables the smooth animation. `max-height: 100px;` sets the initial, collapsed height.
* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand.
* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the inner content of the card for better visual presentation. You can customize these to your needs.
