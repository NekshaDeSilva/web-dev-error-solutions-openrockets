This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  This effect utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly expand a card when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  We'll use plain CSS for maximum browser compatibility.

## Description of the Styling

The card starts in a compact state, displaying only a title and a small thumbnail image. Upon hovering over the card, it expands horizontally, revealing a larger image and additional text content. The expansion is animated smoothly using CSS transitions.  The reveal is subtly staged: the image expands first, followed by the text.


## Full Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  overflow: hidden;
  perspective: 1000px; /* for 3D transition smoothness */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* overall transition */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1); /* expands the card */
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* adds a subtle shadow on hover */
}

.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out 0.1s; /* image expands slightly later */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out 0.2s; /* text fades in later */
  opacity: 0; /* initially hidden */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  opacity: 1; /* text becomes visible on hover */
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-image" style="background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/200x100');"></div>
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3 class="card-title">Card Title</h3>
    <p>This is some example text for the card.  You can put anything here!</p>
  </div>
</div>

```

## Explanation

* **`perspective`:**  This property is crucial for creating a smooth 3D scaling effect, preventing distortion during the expansion.
* **`transition`:** This property defines the animation for the transformations. The `ease-in-out` timing function creates a smooth acceleration and deceleration.  The delayed transition on the image and text creates the subtle reveal effect.
* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This enlarges the card on hover.
* **`box-shadow`:** Adds a visual cue of interaction.
* **`opacity`:** Controls the visibility of the text content.
*  The `background-image` in the `card-image` div uses a placeholder image URL. Replace this with your own image.
