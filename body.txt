## Description of the Error

A common issue in MongoDB development is creating too many indexes. While indexes drastically improve query performance, an excessive number can negatively impact write performance and storage space.  This happens because each index consumes disk space and needs to be updated every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This can lead to slow write operations, increased storage costs, and even performance degradation on read operations if the overhead of index maintenance outweighs the benefits.  The MongoDB shell may not directly throw an error, but you'll observe significantly slower write speeds and increased storage utilization.

## Step-by-Step Code for Fixing the Problem

This solution focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  We'll use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list existing indexes and assess their usage.  We'll then use `db.collection.dropIndex()` to remove underutilized or redundant indexes.

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes:**

First, connect to your MongoDB database and choose the collection you want to analyze.  Replace `<your_database>` and `<your_collection>` with your actual database and collection names.

```javascript
use <your_database>;
db.<your_collection>.getIndexes();
```

This will return a list of indexes. Pay attention to the following:

* **`key`:** This field shows the indexed fields and their order.
* **`name`:**  This is the name of the index.  Often, it reflects the indexed fields.
* **Usage statistics (optional):** You can enable index usage statistics for more precise identification of unused indexes.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage (Optional but Recommended):**

Enable index usage statistics (if not already enabled):

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables profiling with slow query logging.  Adjust level as needed.
```

Run some representative queries against your collection.  Then, examine the profiling data to determine which indexes are frequently used and which are not.

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({ "ns" : "<your_database>.<your_collection>" }).sort({ $natural: -1})
```

Look for queries that use the indexes. Unutilized indexes will not appear in this output.

**Step 3: Drop Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the analysis, drop the indexes that are deemed unnecessary using their name:


```javascript
db.<your_collection>.dropIndex("<index_name_to_drop>"); // Replace with the actual index name.
```

For example, if you have an index named `_id_`, which is automatically created and essential, you would **not** drop it.

**Step 4: Verify Changes:**

After dropping indexes, re-run `db.collection.getIndexes()` to verify that the unwanted indexes are removed. Monitor your write performance and storage usage to ensure the changes have a positive impact.

**Step 5: (Optional) Re-evaluate Indexing Strategy:**

Consider if your indexing strategy needs a complete overhaul.  Are there compound indexes you could create to optimize multiple queries? Could you use a more efficient data model?


## Explanation

The key to avoiding "too many indexes" issues is proactive index management.  Over-indexing can severely hamper write performance because MongoDB must update all indexes every time a document changes.  Careful analysis of query patterns and efficient index selection are crucial for optimal database performance.  Using the profiling level and examining the profiling log will give insight into index usage. Remember to only drop indexes you are absolutely sure are unnecessary.
