This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The effect involves a card that smoothly expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  We'll achieve this using CSS transitions and transformations. This technique is suitable for various projects and requires no JavaScript.


## Description of the Styling

The card starts with a fixed height, displaying only a title and a small preview. On hover, the card's height expands to reveal more content hidden beneath.  A subtle visual cue, a slight shadow change, is also added to enhance the user experience.


## Full Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the initial height */
  transition: height 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height and shadow */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-description {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card Example</h2>
    <p class="card-description">This is a short preview of the card content.  Hover over the card to see the full content expand.</p>
    <p class="card-description">This is the hidden content that will be revealed on hover. You can add more text or other elements here as needed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


## Explanation

* **`transition: height 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;`**: This line is crucial. It defines a smooth transition for both the `height` and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds using an "ease" timing function.  This creates the smooth expanding and shadow animation.

* **`height: 100px;` and `height: 300px;`**: These set the initial and expanded heights of the card, respectively. Adjust these values to suit your design.

* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the hidden content from overflowing the initial card height before the hover effect.

* **`box-shadow`**:  This property creates a subtle shadow, enhancing the 3D effect. The values are adjusted on hover to provide a more pronounced shadow, further emphasizing the expansion.

* **The HTML Structure:** The HTML uses simple divs to structure the card, title, and description.  You can easily customize the content within the `.card-content` div.
