This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands to reveal more content when hovered over, providing a visually engaging user experience without the need for JavaScript. This example utilizes standard CSS3 properties.

**Description of the Styling:**

The effect is achieved primarily using the `transition` property combined with the `:hover` pseudo-class and strategically adjusted padding and height.  The card initially displays a smaller height showing only a summary. On hover, the height expands to reveal the full content.  We also use a subtle box-shadow for visual enhancement.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initial height */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  padding: 15px;
  width: 300px; /* Adjust as needed */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 250px; /* Height when hovered */
}

.card-content {
  /* Prevents text from overflowing and causing jumps during transition */
  overflow: hidden;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <p>This is a short summary of the card's content.  More details will be revealed upon hover.</p>
    <p>This is some additional content that will only be visible when the card is expanded.</p>
    <p>Further expansion to fully demonstrate the effect.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`**: This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from spilling beyond the initial height. `transition: height 0.3s ease;` ensures a smooth transition when the height changes.
* **`.card:hover`**: This targets the card when the mouse hovers over it. The `height` is increased to reveal the full content.
* **`.card-content`**: This class prevents abrupt jump or visual glitches during the expansion by preventing overflow.
* **`transition: height 0.3s ease;`**: This CSS property defines the animation for the height change.  `0.3s` is the duration and `ease` is the timing function.  Experiment with different durations and timing functions (e.g., `linear`, `ease-in-out`) to achieve the desired effect.
