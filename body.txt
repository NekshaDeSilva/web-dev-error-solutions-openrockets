## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered when using Video.js in responsive web designs is the player's height not adjusting correctly to maintain aspect ratio when the browser window is resized. This often results in a stretched or squashed video, ruining the viewing experience.  The issue stems from the default behavior of Video.js not inherently integrating with the fluidity of responsive layouts.  The player might maintain a fixed height, ignoring changes in the container's dimensions.

## Fixing Step-by-Step (Code)

This example demonstrates fixing the height issue using CSS and a bit of JavaScript to ensure the player maintains its aspect ratio regardless of the container size.  We'll assume your Video.js player is initialized within a div with the ID "my-video".

**1. HTML Structure:**

```html
<div id="my-video"></div>
<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script>
  // JavaScript will go here.
</script>
```

**2. CSS Styling:**

This CSS is crucial for maintaining the aspect ratio. We'll use padding-bottom to dynamically adjust the height based on the width.  This method avoids using JavaScript to directly manipulate height.

```css
#my-video {
  position: relative; /* Required for absolute positioning of the video */
  width: 100%; /* Make the container take up full available width */
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio (adjust as needed) */
  height: 0; /* Override default height to maintain aspect ratio */
}

#my-video video {
  position: absolute; /* Ensures video fills the container */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

**3. JavaScript Initialization (Optional - for advanced controls):**

While the CSS above solves the core problem, you might want to use JavaScript for additional Video.js functionality or more dynamic aspect ratio control if you're using different video aspect ratios.

```javascript
var player = videojs('my-video', {
    sources: [{
        src: 'your-video.mp4',
        type: 'video/mp4'
    }],
    controls: true,
    fluid: true //Enables fluid responsiveness.  May be unnecessary with CSS alone.
});

//Optional: Event Listener for further responsive adjustments.
// window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
//   // You could add additional logic here if necessary for very complex responsive scenarios.
// });
```

Replace `'your-video.mp4'` with the actual path to your video file.

## Explanation

The core solution lies in the CSS.  By setting `padding-bottom` as a percentage of the width, we create a container whose height is always proportional to its width, maintaining the desired aspect ratio (16:9 in this case, adjust as needed for other ratios).  Setting the `height` to `0` ensures the padding-bottom effectively controls the height.  The absolute positioning of the `video` element within the container ensures it fills the entire space defined by the padding.  JavaScript is used only for the basic VideoJS player setup and optional event handling for very complex scenarios.  The `fluid: true` option can also be used directly in Video.js, though using CSS gives you more control and works even without using the `fluid` option.
