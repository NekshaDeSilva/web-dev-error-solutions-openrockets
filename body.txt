## Description of the Error

One common issue MongoDB developers encounter is having too many indexes on a collection. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation during write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because every write operation must update all relevant indexes, and with too many, this update process becomes a bottleneck, slowing down the entire database.  This can manifest as slow application performance, especially noticeable during periods of high write activity.  The MongoDB profiler might reveal that index operations are consuming a disproportionate amount of time.

## Full Code of Fixing Step by Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes using the MongoDB shell.  Assume our collection is named `products` and we suspect index bloat.

**Step 1: List Existing Indexes**

First, we need to see what indexes currently exist:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This command will return a list of all indexes on the `products` collection, showing their keys, uniqueness, and other properties.  Carefully examine this list.

**Step 2: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Analyze the output from Step 1. Look for indexes that:

* **Are rarely used:**  Use the MongoDB profiler (`db.setProfilingLevel(2)`) to monitor query performance and identify indexes that aren't frequently used in queries.  Run some representative queries against your database.
* **Are redundant:** Check if multiple indexes cover similar query patterns.  If one index effectively serves the purpose of multiple others, remove the redundant ones.
* **Are overly broad:** Indexes on multiple fields might be too general if queries rarely use all of those fields together.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified unnecessary indexes, you can remove them using `db.products.dropIndex()`.  Replace `<index_name>` with the name of the index (you'll see these names in the output from `getIndexes()`).  For example:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("myCompoundIndex_1"); // Example - replace with your index name
db.products.dropIndex({ "field1": 1, "field2": -1 }); // Example - removing an index by key pattern

```

You can also drop indexes by specifying their key pattern instead of their name. The `dropIndex()` command using the key pattern will drop all indexes matching that exact key pattern.


**Step 4: Verify the change**

After dropping indexes, run `db.products.getIndexes()` again to confirm that the unwanted indexes have been removed.   Monitor your application's performance to ensure that write operations have improved.

## Explanation

The "too many indexes" problem stems from the trade-off between read and write performance. Indexes significantly accelerate read operations by reducing the amount of data MongoDB needs to scan. However, every write operation requires updating all affected indexes, adding overhead.  Having too many indexes amplifies this overhead, potentially negating the performance gains from individual indexes.  Strategic index selection is crucial: only index fields used frequently in queries, and strive for minimal redundancy.  Regularly reviewing and optimizing your indexes is a vital part of MongoDB database administration.
