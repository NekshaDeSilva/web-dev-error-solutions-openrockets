This document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: inconsistencies in the `request.nextUrl.pathname` property, particularly when dealing with redirects or rewriting URLs.  This often leads to unexpected behavior and broken functionality.  The problem arises when the middleware attempts to access `request.nextUrl.pathname` before the URL has been fully processed by the rewrites or redirects defined in the `middleware.ts` file itself, or in your `next.config.js`.

**Description of the Error:**

The primary symptom is that `request.nextUrl.pathname` doesn't reflect the final, rewritten URL after applying rewrites or redirects within the middleware. This leads to logic errors within the middleware itself,  causing incorrect responses or unexpected redirects.  For instance, you might intend to rewrite `/old-path` to `/new-path`, but your middleware logic based on `request.nextUrl.pathname` still sees `/old-path`, leading to incorrect processing.  The middleware might appear to function correctly initially but then fails unpredictably based on the order of operations.

**Code Example (Problematic):**

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req: Request) {
  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname;

  if (pathname === '/old-path') {
    // This won't work as expected because pathname is still '/old-path' before rewrite.
    console.log('Attempting to redirect /old-path');  
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-path', req.url));
  }

  //Other middleware logic
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-path'],
};
```


**Step-by-Step Fix:**

To resolve this, we need to ensure that `request.nextUrl.pathname` reflects the changes made by the rewrite/redirect *after* the rewrite/redirect has been applied.  This can be accomplished by using the `NextResponse` object's `rewrite` or `redirect` methods within the middleware and then using the `NextResponse` itself to trigger the navigation change instead of relying on implicit browser behavior.

**Corrected Code:**

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req: Request) {
  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname;

  if (pathname === '/old-path') {
    console.log('Redirecting /old-path to /new-path');
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-path', req.url)); // Directly redirect
  }

  //Other middleware logic that will now correctly see the rewritten URL
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/old-path'],
};
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code directly uses `NextResponse.redirect` or `NextResponse.rewrite` to manage the URL changes. This ensures Next.js properly processes the redirection/rewrite *before* the middleware continues execution, thereby giving `request.nextUrl.pathname` the expected value.  The original code attempted to rely on implicit redirection, leading to the inconsistency.
