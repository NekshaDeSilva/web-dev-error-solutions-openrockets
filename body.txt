This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the "headers already sent" error. This typically occurs when you attempt to send a response from your middleware more than once or try to send headers after data has already been sent to the client.  This is especially prevalent when you're interacting with external APIs or making multiple calls within your middleware.

**Description of the Error:**

The `headers already sent` error in Next.js Middleware manifests as a server-side error preventing the application from responding correctly to client requests.  It indicates that your middleware function has already committed a response to the client (by sending headers and/or body data), and then attempts to modify or send more headers or body data. This violates the HTTP protocol's single-response rule.


**Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's imagine a scenario where we're using middleware to authenticate users based on a JWT (JSON Web Token) stored in a cookie.  The faulty code attempts to redirect the user if the token is invalid *and* then logs an error. This double write attempts to send headers multiple times leading to the error.

**Faulty Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    console.log('Unauthorized access. Redirecting...');
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url)) //First Header Send
  }

  console.error("An error occured"); //Second Header send attempt after redirect attempt

  return NextResponse.next();
}


export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],
}
```

**Fixed Code (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Consolidate Responses:** Instead of multiple `NextResponse` calls, use conditional logic to determine the appropriate response *before* sending anything to the client.

2. **Early Exit:** If a response is determined (e.g., redirect), exit the function immediately using `return`.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],
}
```


**Explanation:**

The corrected code avoids the error by ensuring that only one `NextResponse` object is returned.  The `if` statement handles the unauthorized access scenario, and the `return` statement ensures that no further code execution attempts to send another response after a redirect has already been sent.
