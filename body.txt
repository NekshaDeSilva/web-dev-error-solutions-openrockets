This document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating CanvasJS charts into responsive web designs: the chart failing to correctly resize or render when the browser window is resized or the viewport changes size. This often manifests as a chart that remains at its initial size, leaving empty space or overlapping elements.

**Description of the Error:**

The chart may render correctly initially, but fails to dynamically adjust its dimensions to fit the available space when the browser window is resized. This is usually observed as a static chart element that does not respond to changes in the container's dimensions.  The chart might appear clipped, stretched, or simply not fill its intended space.  The browser's developer console may not always show explicit errors, making debugging challenging.

**Code and Step-by-Step Fixing:**

This example assumes you're using a basic HTML structure and including CanvasJS via a CDN.  The core issue lies in ensuring the chart's container is correctly sized and that the CanvasJS `render()` method is called after any size changes.

**Incorrect Code (Example):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CanvasJS Responsive Issue</title>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 500px;"></div>
<script>
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        title:{
            text: "My Chart"
        },
        data: [
        {
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
                { label: "Orange", y: 15  },
                { label: "Banana", y: 25  }
            ]
        }
        ]
    });
    chart.render();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Corrected Code (Responsive Implementation):**

This version uses JavaScript to dynamically resize the chart container and trigger a re-render when the window is resized.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CanvasJS Responsive Chart</title>
<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
<style>
  #chartContainer {
    width: 100%; /* Crucial for responsive behavior */
    height: 300px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div id="chartContainer"></div>
<script>
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        title:{
            text: "My Responsive Chart"
        },
        data: [
        {
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
                { label: "Orange", y: 15  },
                { label: "Banana", y: 25  }
            ]
        }
        ]
    });
    chart.render();

    window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
        chart.render(); // Re-render on window resize
    });
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

The key changes are:

1. **`width: 100%;`:**  This CSS rule makes the chart container occupy the full width of its parent element, enabling responsive scaling.
2. **`window.addEventListener('resize', function() { chart.render(); });`:** This JavaScript code adds an event listener that triggers the `chart.render()` method whenever the browser window is resized. This forces CanvasJS to recalculate the chart's dimensions and redraw it to fit the new space.

**Conclusion:**

By applying these changes, you ensure your CanvasJS chart adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and browser window dimensions, providing a much more user-friendly and responsive experience.  Remember to adjust the CSS styling to fit your specific layout requirements.
