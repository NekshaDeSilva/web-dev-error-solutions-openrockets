This document details a CSS-only technique for creating an expanding card effect.  This effect is achieved purely through CSS transitions and transforms, without relying on JavaScript.  This makes it lightweight, performant, and easily integrable into any project.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card utilizes a simple structure: a container element holding an image and a text section.  On hover, the card expands horizontally, revealing more of the underlying text, while simultaneously subtly changing the background color. The transition is smooth and visually appealing, thanks to CSS transitions.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflowing content during expansion */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, background-color 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scaleX(1.1); /* Expand horizontally on hover */
  background-color: #e0e0e0; /* Subtle background color change */
  cursor: pointer;
}

.card img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  display: block; /* Prevents extra space below the image */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
  opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Fade-in transition */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  opacity: 1; /* Fade-in on hover */
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x200" alt="Card Image">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <p>This is some sample text for the expanding card.  It will be revealed smoothly on hover.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`transition` property:**  This is key to the animation.  It defines which properties (`transform`, `background-color`, `opacity`) will smoothly transition over 0.3 seconds with an `ease-in-out` timing function.
* **`transform: scaleX(1.1)`:** This scales the card horizontally by 110% on hover, creating the expansion effect.
* **`overflow: hidden`:** This prevents the content from overflowing the card before the expansion.
* **Opacity transition for `.card-content`:** This ensures the text fades in smoothly along with the expansion.
