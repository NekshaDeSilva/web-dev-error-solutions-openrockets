This document addresses a common misconception when using Next.js Middleware: attempting to use `NextResponse.redirect()` within API routes.  While Middleware is designed for modifying requests before they reach your page components or API routes, API routes themselves should handle redirection differently.  Using `NextResponse.redirect()` in an API route will result in a server error.


**Description of the Error:**

Attempting to use `NextResponse.redirect()` inside a Next.js API route will typically throw a server error, often indicating an unexpected response type or a mismatch between the expected JSON response and the redirect attempt. The error message might vary depending on the specific setup, but will generally highlight the incompatibility of `NextResponse` within the API route context.


**Incorrect Code (Example):**

```javascript
// pages/api/redirect.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    // INCORRECT: NextResponse is not available in API routes.
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/somewhere', req.url))
  }
  res.status(405).end() // Method Not Allowed
}
```


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**


Instead of `NextResponse.redirect()`, API routes should utilize the standard `res` object to perform redirects using the appropriate HTTP status code.  Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// pages/api/redirect.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    // CORRECT: Use res.redirect() in API routes.
    res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/somewhere' })
    res.end()
  } else {
    res.status(405).end() // Method Not Allowed
  }
}

```

**Explanation:**

* **`res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/somewhere' })`**: This sets the HTTP status code to 307 (Temporary Redirect) and specifies the redirect location using the `Location` header. The `307` status code ensures that subsequent requests maintain the original HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).  You could also use `302` (Found), but `307` is generally preferred for better consistency.
* **`res.end()`**: This concludes the response, sending the redirect instruction to the client's browser.

This approach correctly handles the redirect within the confines of a Next.js API route, avoiding the conflict with `NextResponse`.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The provided example includes basic error handling for unsupported HTTP methods.  More robust error handling should be implemented in production environments.
* **Absolute vs. Relative URLs:**  Ensure you are using the correct URL type for your redirect. The example uses a relative path ('/somewhere').  If you need to redirect to an external domain, use an absolute URL.
