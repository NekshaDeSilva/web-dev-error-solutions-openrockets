This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  This effect involves a card that reveals more content upon hovering or clicking. We'll achieve this using pure CSS, avoiding any JavaScript.  This example uses standard CSS3, but could easily be adapted to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card is designed with a basic structure: a container holding an image and some text.  The key to the expanding effect is the use of CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class. On hover, the card's height increases to reveal hidden content, smoothly transitioning due to the applied transitions.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 300px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block; /* Removes extra space below the image */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content until expanded */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card:hover .card-content {
  height: 100px; /* Height when expanded */
}

/* Optional: Add some styling for the text content */
.card-content p {
  margin: 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x150" alt="Card Image">
  <div class="card-content">
    <p>This is some extra content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.</p>
    <p>More text can be added here.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`.card`**: This class styles the overall card, including width, border radius, shadow and the crucial `transition` property for smooth animations.
*   **`.card img`**:  This styles the image to fit the card's width. `display: block` prevents the image from creating extra spacing.
*   **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content area.  `height: 0` initially hides the content, and `overflow: hidden` ensures that the hidden content doesn't cause layout issues.  The `transition` property mirrors that of the `.card` class.
*   **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This is the key selector.  It targets the `.card-content` only when the `.card` is hovered over, setting the `height` to `100px` (or adjust as needed) to reveal the content.
