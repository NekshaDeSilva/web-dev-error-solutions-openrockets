This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  No JavaScript is required.  This example utilizes plain CSS; you could easily adapt it to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `max-height` property. Initially, the card has a `max-height` set to a small value, hiding the extra content. On hover, the `max-height` is changed to `100%`, allowing the card to expand to its full height, revealing the hidden content.  We use transitions to smooth out the animation.  Padding and some basic styling are added for visual appeal.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for smooth animation */
  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */
  padding: 15px;
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  max-height: 100%; /* Expand on hover */
}

.card-content {
  
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-text {
  font-size: 14px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
  <p class="card-text">This is some sample text that will be hidden initially. The card will expand to show this text when you hover over it. This is a longer paragraph to demonstrate the expanding effect more clearly.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial; it prevents the content from overflowing its initial height before the expansion. The `transition` property ensures a smooth animation when the `max-height` changes.
* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  Setting `max-height: 100%;` allows the card to expand vertically to fit all its content.
* **`.card-title` and `.card-text`:** These classes are used for basic styling of the card's title and text.
