## Description of the Error

A common performance issue in MongoDB arises from having too many indexes. While indexes speed up queries, an excessive number can significantly hinder write performance.  Every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all relevant indexes, and too many indexes increase this overhead, leading to slower write times and potentially impacting overall database performance.  The symptoms might include slow application response times for write-heavy operations, increased latency, and high CPU utilization on the database server.  The MongoDB profiler might reveal that index maintenance is consuming a disproportionate amount of time.


## Step-by-Step Code Fix

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes.  We'll use the MongoDB shell.  Assume we have a collection named `products`.

**1. Identify Existing Indexes:**

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This command lists all indexes on the `products` collection.  Pay close attention to the `key` field, which shows the indexed fields.


**2. Analyze Index Usage:**

The most effective way to identify underutilized indexes requires monitoring your application's query patterns over time.  MongoDB's profiler can help.  However, for a quick assessment, you can consider:

* **Query patterns:**  Do you consistently use specific queries? Indexes supporting those queries are likely valuable.
* **Selectivity:** An index with high selectivity (few documents matching the index key) is generally more beneficial than one with low selectivity.  A highly selective index helps narrow down searches efficiently.
* **Data distribution:** Consider how data is distributed within the indexed fields. A uniformly distributed field benefits more from indexing than one with a skewed distribution.


**3. Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Once you've identified indexes that aren't frequently used or offer minimal performance benefits, you can drop them.  For example, let's say the output from `db.products.getIndexes()` shows an index on `{"description": 1}` that is rarely used:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex({"description": 1})
```

Repeat this process for each unnecessary index.


**4. Monitor Performance:**

After dropping indexes, carefully monitor your application's performance using appropriate monitoring tools.  Compare write times and CPU usage before and after the index removal to gauge the impact of the changes.


## Explanation

The key to effective index management is finding the right balance between read and write performance. Too few indexes will lead to slow queries, while too many will negatively impact write performance. A thorough understanding of your application's query patterns, data distribution, and the selectivity of your indexes is crucial for making informed decisions about index creation and removal. Regularly reviewing and optimizing your indexes is a vital aspect of MongoDB database administration.  The `db.products.getIndexes()` command is fundamental for this process.
