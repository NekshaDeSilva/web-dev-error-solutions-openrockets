This document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11):  charts failing to render correctly or not rendering at all. This is often due to IE11's limitations in handling certain Canvas features or its compatibility with modern JavaScript libraries.


**Description of the Error:**

In IE11, you might observe the following:

* A blank space where the CanvasJS chart should be.
* A partially rendered chart with missing elements.
* Console errors related to Canvas or rendering contexts.
* General instability or crashes related to the chart.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

The most effective solution usually involves using a polyfill to provide missing Canvas functionality that IE11 lacks.  We'll use `excanvas` for this example.  Note that this is an older library;  modern solutions might involve a more recent alternative that supports IE11 and offers improved features.

**Step 1: Include the `excanvas` library.**

Add the following `<script>` tag in your HTML file, preferably *before* including the CanvasJS script:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/excanvas/r3/excanvas.min.js"></script>
```

**Step 2: Ensure Correct CanvasJS Inclusion.**

Make sure you have correctly included the CanvasJS library. This usually involves adding a `<script>` tag linking to your CanvasJS files (usually a `canvasjs.min.js` file).

```html
<script src="path/to/canvasjs.min.js"></script>  <!-- Replace with your actual path -->
```

**Step 3:  Verify Chart Initialization.**

Confirm your CanvasJS chart initialization code is correct.  A common example:

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        title:{
            text: "My Chart"
        },
        data: [
        {
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { x: 10, y: 71 },
                { x: 20, y: 55},
                { x: 30, y: 50 },
                { x: 40, y: 65 }
            ]
        }
        ]
    });
    chart.render();
};
```

**Step 4:  Check for Container Element.**

Make sure that the element with the ID "chartContainer" (or whatever ID you're using) exists in your HTML:

```html
<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 500px;"></div>
```



**Explanation:**

`excanvas` is a shim that provides a basic implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API for older browsers that lack native support. By including it, you provide a fallback for IE11, allowing CanvasJS to function even without complete native Canvas support.


**External References:**

* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)  (Check their documentation for browser compatibility information and potential alternative solutions.)
* **excanvas (archive):**  Finding a reliable, current download link for excanvas might be difficult since it is no longer actively maintained.  Search for "excanvas" on a package manager like npm or look for archived versions on GitHub.  Consider modern alternatives for better support and security.


**Important Note:**  While `excanvas` might resolve rendering issues in IE11, it's crucial to remember that IE11 is a legacy browser.  Consider upgrading to a modern browser for optimal performance, security, and compatibility with current web technologies.  If supporting IE11 is unavoidable, thorough testing is essential.
