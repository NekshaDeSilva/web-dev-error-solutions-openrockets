This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class.  The card expands when the mouse hovers over it, revealing more content.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card uses a simple design with a background color, padding, and rounded corners. The content initially is hidden using `max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;`. On hover, the `max-height` is increased to a value that allows the full content to show, and the `overflow` is set to `visible`.  A smooth transition is applied to the `max-height` property, creating the expanding animation.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 20px;
  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */
  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  max-height: 300px; /* Height when hovering */
  overflow: visible; /* Show full content */
}

.card-content {
  /* Style the content inside the card */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is some example content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  You can add as much text and other elements as you need inside this card.  This is a simple demonstration of how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required!  Isn't that neat?</p>
  </div>

**Explanation:**

* **`transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line applies a transition to the `max-height` property.  The `0.3s` specifies the duration of the transition (0.3 seconds), and `ease-in-out` specifies the timing function, creating a smooth animation.

* **`max-height: 100px;`**: This sets the initial height of the card.  The content will be hidden if it exceeds this height.

* **`max-height: 300px;` (on hover):**  When the mouse hovers over the card, the `max-height` is increased to `300px`, allowing the full content to be shown. Adjust this value to fit your content.

* **`overflow: hidden;` and `overflow: visible;`**:  These control whether content outside the `max-height` is visible.  Initially hidden, it becomes visible on hover.
