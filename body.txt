## Description of the Error

A common problem in MongoDB is having too many indexes. While indexes dramatically speed up query performance, an excessive number can significantly degrade write performance.  Adding an index involves extra disk space and time to update the index every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  This write slowdown can outweigh the benefits of faster reads, especially in write-heavy applications.  The symptoms include slow insertion and update operations, increased latency, and potentially application instability.  MongoDB itself might log warnings about slow index operations or exceeding limits on the number of indexes per collection.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary indexes in a collection called "products".  Assume you have a MongoDB instance running and access to the `mongo` shell.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes for your collection:

```javascript
use your_database_name; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes();
```

This will output a JSON array of index specifications.  Pay close attention to the `key` field which describes the indexed fields and their order.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

The crucial step is determining which indexes are truly necessary. MongoDB Profiler can help. Enable profiling:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Level 2 profiles all operations
```

Run several queries representative of your application's usage. Then examine the profiling logs:

```javascript
db.system.profile.find({millis:{$gt:10}}).sort({ts:-1}) //Find slow queries
```

This will show you which queries executed slowly and which indexes were (or were not) used.  This reveals whether existing indexes are helpful or redundant.

**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on your analysis from Step 2, identify indexes that aren't contributing significantly to query performance. Remove them using `db.collection.dropIndex()`:

```javascript
//Example: Remove an index on the 'category' field
db.products.dropIndex("category_1");

//Example: Remove a compound index on 'category' and 'price'
db.products.dropIndex({"category": 1, "price": -1});
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance. Use MongoDB's monitoring tools or your application's logging to track write speeds and overall responsiveness.  If performance doesn't improve or even worsens, carefully review your index selection strategy.


## Explanation

The root cause of the "too many indexes" problem is a lack of careful planning and ongoing optimization of indexing strategy.  Adding indexes without a deep understanding of query patterns leads to unnecessary overhead. The profiling step is essential;  it provides data-driven insights into actual query performance, allowing for informed decisions about which indexes to keep and which to remove.  Removing unnecessary indexes reduces write overhead, freeing up resources for faster insertions and updates.  The focus should always be on creating a balanced system where the benefits of faster reads aren't overshadowed by slower writes.
