This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card with a subtle reveal effect.  The effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms, without any JavaScript.  We'll use standard CSS3 properties, making it compatible with most modern browsers.


**Description of the Styling:**

This design creates a card that initially shows only a small portion of its content. Upon hovering, the card expands vertically, revealing the full content with a smooth transition.  A subtle shadow enhances the 3D effect.  The colour scheme is simple and can be easily customized.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Expand on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3>This is the title</h3>
    <p>This is some sample text that will be revealed upon hovering over the card.  You can add more content here as needed.  The card expands smoothly to accommodate it.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the card itself.  `width` and `height` set the initial dimensions. `background-color`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` provide visual appeal.  Crucially, `overflow: hidden` ensures the content exceeding the initial height is initially hidden.  `transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out` enables a smooth transition when the height changes.

* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `height: 300px` increases the height, triggering the transition defined in `.card`.

* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content within the card.  `padding` adds some spacing.

The interaction is entirely driven by the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `transition` property. No JavaScript is required.
