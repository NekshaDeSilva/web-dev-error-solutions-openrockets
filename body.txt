## Description of the Error

A common problem when using CanvasJS charts within a responsive web application is the chart failing to render correctly or rendering at an incorrect size, especially when the browser window is resized. This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should be, a distorted chart, or a chart that doesn't scale proportionally with the containing element.  The issue stems from the chart's dimensions not dynamically adjusting to the changes in the browser window or container size. This is particularly noticeable when using percentage-based widths and heights for the chart container.

## Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step

This solution demonstrates how to properly integrate a CanvasJS chart into a responsive design using JavaScript. We'll assume you already have CanvasJS included in your project.

**Step 1: Ensure Correct Container Sizing:**

First, we need to ensure that the container element for the CanvasJS chart has correctly defined dimensions.  Avoid hardcoded pixel values; instead, use percentage-based widths or a flexible layout approach (like flexbox or grid) to enable responsiveness.

```html
<div id="chartContainer" style="width: 100%; height: 300px;"></div>
```

**Step 2:  Initialize CanvasJS Chart with `render()` inside a `resize` event listener:**

This is the crucial step.  Instead of rendering the chart immediately, we'll render it *after* the page has loaded and subsequently whenever the window is resized. This ensures that the chart always adapts to its container's size.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function () {
    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
        title: {
            text: "Responsive Chart"
        },
        data: [{
            type: "column",
            dataPoints: [
                { x: 10, y: 71 },
                { x: 20, y: 55 },
                { x: 30, y: 50 },
                { x: 40, y: 65 },
                { x: 50, y: 92 }
            ]
        }]
    });
    chart.render(); //Initial render

    window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
        chart.render(); //Render on resize
    });
});
```

**Step 3 (Optional): Use CanvasJS's `updateOptions()` method for more fine-grained control:**

For complex scenarios, instead of calling `render()` directly, you can use `updateOptions()` to modify the chart's options (like `width` and `height`) before rendering. This allows for more precise control over the resizing process.  This is particularly useful when you want to recalculate the chart's dimensions based on dynamically changing container sizes.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    let containerWidth = document.getElementById('chartContainer').offsetWidth;
    let containerHeight = document.getElementById('chartContainer').offsetHeight;
    chart.updateOptions({width: containerWidth, height: containerHeight}); 
});
```



## Explanation

The core issue is that CanvasJS, by default, doesn't automatically re-render when the container size changes.  By wrapping the `chart.render()` call within a `resize` event listener, we explicitly tell the chart to redraw itself whenever the browser window is resized.  This ensures that the chart always fits perfectly within its allocated space, maintaining its responsiveness. Using `updateOptions()` offers more precise control by enabling updates to chart properties, such as dimensions, alongside the rendering.
