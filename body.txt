This document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware alongside `getServerSideProps` in pages.  The problem arises when trying to redirect a user within `getServerSideProps` *after* Middleware has already executed some actions.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially broken functionality.

**Description of the Error:**

The error manifests as an inconsistent user experience.  The middleware might perform actions like setting cookies or modifying headers, but the subsequent redirect in `getServerSideProps` might override these changes or lead to the middleware's effects being bypassed entirely.  The user might be redirected as intended, but without the intended side effects of the middleware.  In some cases, you might encounter error messages related to the middleware's execution context or conflicting responses.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where you want to authenticate users.  Middleware checks for an authentication token in a cookie. If the token is missing or invalid, it should redirect to the login page.  However, if there's an additional condition (e.g., based on user roles) requiring a further redirect *after* authentication is confirmed (in `getServerSideProps`), a conflict arises.

**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

Let's assume we have the following structure:

* **`middleware.js` (middleware):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // Only apply to protected routes
};
```

* **`pages/protected/dashboard.js` (page):**

```javascript
import { getServerSideProps } from 'next/server';

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // ... some code to validate user role ...
  if (context.query.role !== 'admin') {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/no-access',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {},
  };
}

export default function Dashboard() {
  return <div>Dashboard</div>;
}
```


This code has a potential conflict. The middleware redirects unauthenticated users, while `getServerSideProps` redirects users without admin privileges.  The correct approach is to consolidate redirection logic within `getServerSideProps` which is executed after Middleware has set cookies and other headers.


**Corrected Code:**


* **`middleware.js` (middleware - unchanged):**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // Only apply to protected routes
};
```

* **`pages/protected/dashboard.js` (page - corrected):**

```javascript
import { getServerSideProps } from 'next/server';

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const token = context.req.cookies.get('auth_token'); // Get token from request object

  if (!token) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }
  // ... some code to validate user role ...
  if (context.query.role !== 'admin') {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/no-access',
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {},
  };
}

export default function Dashboard() {
  return <div>Dashboard</div>;
}

```

In this corrected version,  `getServerSideProps` handles *both* authentication and role-based redirection. This ensures a consistent and predictable flow, preventing conflicts with the middleware's actions.  The Middleware now solely handles the initial authentication check, and the subsequent redirection logic is wholly within `getServerSideProps`.

**Explanation:**

The key change is moving the entire redirection logic into `getServerSideProps`. This allows  the middleware to perform its tasks (setting cookies, etc.), and then `getServerSideProps` can build upon that by validating the user context completely and performing any necessary redirects.
