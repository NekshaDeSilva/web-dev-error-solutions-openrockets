This document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating CanvasJS charts into web pages with responsive layouts: chart elements not scaling correctly or being clipped when the browser window is resized. This often manifests as truncated labels, overlapping elements, or charts that fail to occupy the available space effectively.


**Description of the Error:**

The CanvasJS chart, while rendered correctly initially, doesn't adapt smoothly to changes in window size.  This leads to visual inconsistencies, especially noticeable on smaller screens or when the browser window is resized.  The chart might be cut off, text might overlap, or elements might appear disproportionately sized. This is often due to a mismatch between the chart's dimensions and the container element's dimensions, especially when using percentage-based sizing.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

This solution utilizes JavaScript to dynamically adjust the chart's dimensions based on its container's size. We'll use `window.addEventListener` to trigger a chart redraw whenever the window resizes.

**1. HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Responsive CanvasJS Chart</title>
  <script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script> </head>
<body>
  <div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**2. JavaScript (script.js):**

```javascript
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  chart.render(); // Redraw the chart on window resize
});

window.onload = function () {

  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart("chartContainer", {
    animationEnabled: true,
    title:{
      text: "Responsive Chart"
    },
    data: [{
      type: "column",
      dataPoints: [
        { label: "Apple",  y: 10  },
        { label: "Orange", y: 15  },
        { label: "Banana", y: 25  }
      ]
    }]
  });
  chart.render();
}
```


**Explanation:**

* **`window.addEventListener('resize', function() { ... });`:** This line attaches an event listener to the `window` object.  The function inside will execute whenever the browser window is resized.
* **`chart.render();`:**  This crucial line within the event listener redraws the CanvasJS chart.  It forces CanvasJS to recalculate the chart's layout and rendering based on the updated dimensions of its container (`#chartContainer`).
* **`window.onload = function() { ... };`:** This ensures the chart is initially rendered when the page loads.
* **`style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"`:**  Using percentage width allows the chart to take up the full width of its container.  A fixed or minimum height is recommended to prevent collapse.

This solution ensures the CanvasJS chart adapts dynamically to the available space, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience across different screen sizes. Remember to replace placeholder data with your actual data points.
