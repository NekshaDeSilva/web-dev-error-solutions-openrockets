This challenge focuses on building a card element that gives the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality using only CSS.  We'll achieve this effect using shadows, gradients, and subtle transformations. This example uses plain CSS3, but could easily be adapted to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card will have a clean, modern look.  The 3D effect is created primarily through a carefully positioned box-shadow to simulate light and shadow on the card's surface.  A subtle gradient will add depth and visual interest.  We'll also slightly elevate the card using `transform: translateY()`.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>3D Card Effect</title>
<style>
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.card {
  width: 300px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15), -10px -10px 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); /* Key for 3D effect */
  padding: 20px;
  transform: translateY(-5px); /* Slight elevation */
  transition: transform 0.2s ease; /* Smooth transition on hover */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Enhanced elevation on hover */
  box-shadow: 12px 12px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), -12px -12px 25px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); /* More pronounced shadow on hover */
}

.card h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.card p {
  line-height: 1.6;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>3D Card</h2>
    <p>This is a sample card with a 3D effect created using only CSS.  Notice the subtle shadows and elevation.  Hover over the card to see the enhanced effect.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`box-shadow`:** This is the core of the 3D effect. We use two `box-shadow` values: one creates a darker shadow below and to the right (simulating light from the top left), and the other creates a lighter shadow above and to the left (highlight).  Adjusting the `x`, `y`, `blur`, and `spread` values allows fine-tuning of the effect.  The `rgba` values control the color and opacity of the shadows.

* **`transform: translateY()`:**  This slightly moves the card upwards, creating a sense of lift and further enhancing the 3D appearance.

* **`transition`:** This provides a smooth animation when hovering over the card, making the interaction more engaging.

* **`background-color` and `border-radius`:** These properties simply enhance the overall appearance of the card.
