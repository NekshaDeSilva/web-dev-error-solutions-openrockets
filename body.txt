## Description of the Error

A common mistake in MongoDB development is creating too many indexes or indexes that are not optimized for specific query patterns.  While indexes dramatically speed up queries, an excessive number can actually hinder performance.  This happens because every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating all relevant indexes.  With numerous indexes, write operations become significantly slower, negating the benefits gained from faster reads.  This is often exacerbated by poorly chosen indexes that are rarely used, leading to wasted disk space and processing overhead.  The overall effect is a decrease in application responsiveness and increased resource consumption.  The system might appear sluggish, and application performance metrics will show high write latency.

## Code Example: Fixing Over-Indexing

This example demonstrates a scenario where we have over-indexed a collection and how to address it. We'll use the `db.collection.stats()` method to identify problematic indexes and then remove or optimize them.

**Scenario:**  Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with fields `name` (string), `price` (number), `category` (string), and `description` (string).  We've created separate indexes on each field:

```javascript
// Assume this is an initial state with many indexes already created.

// Example indexes already present (hypothetical)
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { price: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )
db.products.createIndex( { description: 1 } ) //This index is rarely used
```

**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

First, we analyze the indexes using `db.collection.stats()`. The `indexer` field in the output will reveal the index usage.  A low usage index is a prime candidate for removal.

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This will return a JSON object. Look within the "indexSizes" array and the "indexDetails" array.  Examine the statistics for each index to assess its usage.  If an index shows very low usage, it's a good candidate for removal.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

Based on the `db.products.stats()` output, let's assume the index on `description` is rarely used. We remove it using `db.collection.dropIndex()`:

```javascript
db.products.dropIndex( { description: 1 } )
```

**Step 3: Optimize Existing Indexes (Compound Index)**

If frequent queries involve multiple fields, consider a compound index. Instead of individual indexes on `name` and `category`, we can create a compound index:

```javascript
db.products.createIndex( { name: 1, category: 1 } )
```

This single compound index will optimize queries filtering by both `name` and `category`.  This is more efficient than two separate indexes. You should carefully analyze your query patterns to select the optimal fields for a compound index. The order of fields in a compound index matters.

**Step 4: Verify Improvement**

After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor your application's performance.  You should observe improvements in write operations and potentially read operations as well.  Use profiling tools to further analyze the impact of these changes on your MongoDB instance.


## Explanation

Over-indexing in MongoDB creates a trade-off: faster reads at the cost of slower writes. The optimal number of indexes depends on your application's workload and query patterns.  It's crucial to analyze your application's queries to identify the most frequently used fields and create indexes accordingly. Using tools to monitor index usage and analyzing query plans are essential to avoid performance bottlenecks caused by over-indexing.
