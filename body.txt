This document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect utilizes CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to create a smooth and visually appealing animation.  We'll be using plain CSS3 for this example.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card starts with a compact layout. Upon hovering over the card, its height expands to reveal hidden content.  The expansion is smoothly animated using CSS transitions.  We'll style the card with a subtle shadow and rounded corners for a modern look.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 250px; /* Height on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.card-text {
  font-size: 14px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p class="card-text">This is the content of the expanding card.  It's initially hidden, but revealed on hover.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to prevent content from spilling out during the height transition.  The `transition` property defines the animation for the `height` property, making the expansion smooth.  The initial `height` is set to a small value.
* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `height` is increased to reveal the hidden content.
* **`.card-content`, `.card-title`, `.card-text`:** These classes provide basic styling for the card's content, title, and text respectively.  You can customize these styles further to match your design preferences.
