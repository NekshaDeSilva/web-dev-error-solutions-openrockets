This document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the dreaded "headers already sent" error.  This usually occurs when you try to set headers in your middleware after some output has already been sent to the client.  This is often subtle and can be tricky to debug.

**Description of the Error:**

The "headers already sent" error in Next.js Middleware (and generally in HTTP) means that your server has already begun sending the HTTP response to the client, including headers.  Attempting to modify headers *after* this initial send is impossible, resulting in the error.  This typically happens when you have unintended output before the `next.NextResponse.rewrite` or `next.NextResponse.redirect` calls within your middleware.

**Code Example (Problem):**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  console.log("Middleware running"); //Unintentional output
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    if (!req.cookies.get('authToken')) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
    }
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],
}
```

In this example, `console.log("Middleware running");` sends output to the console *before* the conditional check for authentication and the subsequent redirect. This can lead to the headers already sent error, particularly in some server environments.


**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**

1. **Identify the unintended output:** Carefully review your middleware function. Look for any `console.log` statements, accidental string literals being returned, or any other form of output that precedes the `NextResponse` methods.

2. **Remove or conditionally execute the output:**  In our example, we remove the `console.log`.  For other cases, you might need to add conditional logic to ensure that the output only occurs under specific circumstances, or refactor it entirely.

3. **Refactor for clean code:**  Often, the root cause is poor code structure. Refactor your middleware to ensure that all output is managed within the conditional logic that handles the `NextResponse` actions.

**Fixed Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
    if (!req.cookies.get('authToken')) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))
    }
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],
}
```

**Explanation:**

The corrected code ensures that the `NextResponse` methods are executed first.  Any other logic is contained within the conditional blocks, preventing unintended output before headers are set.  This ensures that the response is handled correctly by Next.js, avoiding the "headers already sent" error.
