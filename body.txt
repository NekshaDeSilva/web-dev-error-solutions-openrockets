## Description of the Error

The "too many connections" error in MongoDB arises when your application attempts to establish more concurrent connections to the MongoDB server than it's configured to handle.  This usually manifests as connection timeouts or errors indicating that the server is unable to accept new connections. This is a common problem, especially in applications with high concurrency or poorly managed connection pools.  The error message itself might vary slightly depending on your driver (e.g., Python's pymongo, Node.js's MongoDB driver), but the core issue remains the same.

## Step-by-Step Code Fix (using Python and pymongo)

This example demonstrates how to address the issue using Python and the pymongo driver. The key is proper connection pooling and efficient connection management.

**Before:** (Illustrative code demonstrating bad practice)

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# ... many concurrent operations here, each creating a new connection ...
for i in range(1000):
    result = collection.find_one({"key": i}) #Each find_one opens a new connection if pool is not used.
    #... processing result
client.close()
```

**After:** (Improved code using connection pooling)

```python
import pymongo

# Configure connection pool settings
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/",
                             maxPoolSize=100, # Adjust as needed, based on server capacity and application needs.
                             connectTimeoutMS=5000, #Timeout value in milliseconds
                             serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000) # Server Selection timeout value in milliseconds
db = client["mydatabase"]
collection = db["mycollection"]

# ... concurrent operations using the same connection pool ...
try:
    with client:
        for i in range(1000):
            result = collection.find_one({"key": i})
            # ... processing result

except pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure as e:
    print(f"Could not connect to MongoDB: {e}")

finally:
  client.close() #This should be executed always even if exception happens.


```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`maxPoolSize`:** This setting limits the maximum number of connections the driver will maintain in its connection pool.  Adjust this value based on your MongoDB server's capacity and the expected concurrency of your application.  Start with a conservative number and monitor your server's performance to optimize it.

2. **`connectTimeoutMS` and `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`:** These values define how long to wait for a connection to be established. Setting reasonable timeouts prevents your application from hanging indefinitely if the MongoDB server is unreachable.

3. **`with client:`:** Using a `with` statement ensures that the connection is properly closed even if exceptions occur during your operations.

4. **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` block catches potential `pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` exceptions, allowing you to handle connection problems gracefully.

## Explanation

The "too many connections" error stems from exceeding the MongoDB server's maximum allowed connections.  Each new connection consumes server resources.  By using a connection pool, your application reuses connections instead of creating new ones for each operation, significantly reducing the number of active connections and preventing the error.  Properly configuring the pool size (`maxPoolSize`) is crucial; it should balance the need for concurrency with the server's capacity to handle connections.  Too small a pool can lead to performance bottlenecks, while too large a pool can still overwhelm the server.
