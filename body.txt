This document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This effect uses CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing animation when a card is hovered over.  We'll be using standard CSS3 properties, making it widely compatible.


**Description of the Styling:**

The styling involves creating a card with a default state and a hover state.  The hover state uses CSS transitions to smoothly animate the scaling and slight shadow offset of the card, creating the "expanding" effect.  We'll also style the card's content to ensure it remains readable and visually appealing within the animation.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  padding: 20px;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for transform and shadow */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand on hover */
  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */
  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate interactivity */
}

.card-content {
  text-align: center;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is a simple card that expands on hover using only CSS!</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the base card.  `border-radius` rounds the corners, `box-shadow` adds a subtle shadow, and `padding` provides inner spacing.  Crucially, `transition` is used to define the smooth animation for `transform` (scaling) and `box-shadow` properties.  The `ease` timing function provides a natural-feeling animation.
* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it. `transform: scale(1.05);` increases the card's size by 5% (you can adjust this value).  The `box-shadow` is increased to create a more pronounced shadow effect. `cursor: pointer;` changes the cursor to a pointer to indicate interactivity.
* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and presentation.
