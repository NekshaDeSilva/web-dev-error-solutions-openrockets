This document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The card expands vertically to reveal more content when hovered over, creating a smooth and engaging user experience. This example uses pure CSS, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to achieve the expanding effect.  Initially, the card's height is set to a minimum, revealing only a summary.  On hover, the height transitions smoothly to its maximum, displaying the full content.  A subtle background shadow is added to enhance visual appeal.  The overall style is clean and modern.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  height: 100px; /* Initial height */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p>This is some example content.  You can add more text here to see the expansion effect in action.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from spilling outside the card during the expansion.  The `transition` property defines the animation for the height change.
* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles specifically when the mouse hovers over the card, increasing its height.
* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and structure.
