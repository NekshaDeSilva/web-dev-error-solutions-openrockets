This document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content. This example uses only CSS3 and avoids JavaScript, making it lightweight and efficient.  We'll leverage CSS transitions for smooth animation.


**Description of the Styling:**

The styling uses a combination of CSS pseudo-classes (`::before` and `:hover`) and transitions to achieve the expanding effect.  The card's height is initially set to a smaller value.  On hover, the `::before` pseudo-element (which contains the hidden content) changes its height, pushing the main content down.  Transitions ensure a smooth animation during the expansion.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the expanding content initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Add smooth transition */
  width: 300px;
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Expand the card height on hover */
}


.card__content {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card::before {
  content: "This is the hidden content that appears on hover.  Add more details here as needed.";
  display: block;
  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content outside visible area */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Match main card transition */
  background-color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
}

.card:hover::before {
  height: 150px; /* Expand the hidden content on hover */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card__content">
    This is the visible content of the card.
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to initially hide the expanding content. The `transition` property specifies the animation for the height change.
* **`.card:hover`:** This pseudo-class targets the card when the mouse hovers over it. It increases the `height` to trigger the expansion.
* **`.card::before`:** This pseudo-element creates the hidden content area. The initial `height: 0` and `overflow: hidden` keep it invisible.  The transition mirrors the main card's animation.
* **`.card:hover::before`:** On hover, the pseudo-element's height is increased, revealing the hidden content.
