This document addresses a common error developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: the "Response already sent" error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to modify the response object multiple times within a single middleware function, often due to improperly structured `if` statements or asynchronous operations.


**Description of the Error:**

The "Response already sent" error in Next.js Middleware means that the response to the client has already been committed, and any further attempts to modify it (e.g., setting headers, redirecting, etc.) will result in this error. This usually happens when multiple `res.redirect()` or `res.end()` calls are executed, potentially within conditional statements or asynchronous functions without proper handling.


**Example Scenario and Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's say we have a middleware function that checks for authentication and redirects unauthenticated users:


**Problematic Code:**

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  // Further checks or modifications to the response...  (This will fail if the above redirect is executed)
  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'value'); // This line causes the error if the if statement above executes
  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile'], // This applies middleware to the /profile route only.
}
```

**Explanation of the Problem:**

The problem lies in the fact that if `!token` is true, the `NextResponse.redirect()` call immediately sends a response to the client.  Any subsequent code, such as setting headers in the `response` object, will try to modify a response that has already been sent, leading to the error.


**Step-by-Step Fix:**

1. **Early Exit:** The most straightforward solution is to use an early return statement to prevent further execution of the middleware function once a response has been sent.  This ensures that only one response is ever sent.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  const response = NextResponse.next();
  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'value');
  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile'],
}
```

2. **Conditional Logic within a Single Response:**  If you need more complex logic, ensure all response modifications are done within a single `NextResponse` object before returning it.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');
  let response;

  if (!token) {
    response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  } else {
    response = NextResponse.next();
    response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'value');
  }
  return response;
}

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/profile'],
}
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

Both solutions above ensure that only a single response is generated and sent to the client. The early return prevents further code execution after a response has been generated. The conditional logic approach within a single `NextResponse` object prevents multiple responses from being sent.  Choosing the best solution depends on the complexity of your middleware logic.
