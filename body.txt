This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect, commonly used for showcasing features, products, or articles. This effect involves a card that expands to reveal more information when clicked or hovered over.  We'll use pure CSS3 for this effect, avoiding JavaScript entirely.


## Description of the Styling

The styling uses a combination of transitions, transforms, and pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) to achieve the expanding effect. The card starts in a compact state. On hover (or click, depending on your preference), the card expands vertically, revealing hidden content.  A subtle shadow effect is added to enhance the visual appeal.


## Full Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 300px;
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the expanding content initially */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 400px; /* Expand the card on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 20px;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-description {
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.6;
  height: 0; /* Initially hide the description */
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the description until expanded */
  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for description height change */
}

.card:hover .card-description {
  height: 100px; /* Expand the description on hover */
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p class="card-description">This is a simple expanding card created using only CSS.  Click or hover to expand and see the full content. This is a demonstration of a simple and effective CSS-only animation technique. You can adjust the height and other styling options to fit your needs.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Explanation

* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to hide the expanded content initially.  The `transition` property smooths the height changes.
* **`.card:hover`**:  This selector applies styles when the mouse hovers over the card.  The `height` property is increased to trigger the expansion.
* **`.card-content`**: This class styles the inner content of the card.
* **`.card-title` and `.card-description`**: These style the title and description.  The `.card-description` uses `height: 0` and `overflow: hidden` to initially hide the content.  The `transition` property again provides a smooth animation.
* **`.card:hover .card-description`**:  This selector targets the description specifically when the card is hovered over, expanding its height.
