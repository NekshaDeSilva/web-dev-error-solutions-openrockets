This document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  This effect involves a card that reveals more content upon hovering or clicking.  We'll achieve this using only CSS transitions and transforms, without relying on JavaScript.  This example will use plain CSS3, but the principles can be adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS easily.


**Description of the Styling:**

The card consists of two main parts: a front face and a back face. The front face displays a summary, while the back face contains the detailed information.  We use CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly transition between the two faces on hover. The key is using the `transform: rotateY()` property to rotate the card around the Y-axis, revealing the back face.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  perspective: 1000px; /* Necessary for 3D transforms */
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  position: relative;
}

.card-face {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden; /* Prevents the back face from showing through */
  transition: transform 0.8s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.card-front {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.card-back {
  background-color: #ddd;
  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Initially hidden */
}

.card:hover .card-front {
  transform: rotateY(-180deg); /* Reveal back face on hover */
}

.card:hover .card-back {
  transform: rotateY(0deg); /* Reveal back face on hover */
}


</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-face card-front">
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <p>Short description here...</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-face card-back">
    <h3>Detailed Information</h3>
    <p>This is where you would put the detailed content of the card.  You can add as much information as you need here.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```


**Explanation:**

* **`perspective`:** This property gives the element a 3D perspective, allowing the rotation to appear realistic.
* **`backface-visibility: hidden;`:** This prevents the back face from being visible while it's hidden behind the front face.
* **`transition`:** This property smoothly animates the `transform` property over 0.8 seconds.
* **`transform: rotateY()`:** This rotates the element around the Y-axis.  The positive values rotate clockwise, while negative values rotate counter-clockwise.
* The `:hover` pseudo-class triggers the rotation on mouse hover.
