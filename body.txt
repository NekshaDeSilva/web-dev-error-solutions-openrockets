This challenge involves creating a stylish button with an animated gradient background using Tailwind CSS. The button will smoothly transition between two colors on hover, creating an engaging visual effect.  We'll utilize Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling and avoid writing extensive custom CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The button will be rectangular, with padding, a rounded border, and a vibrant gradient background that animates on hover.  The text within the button will be white, providing good contrast against the gradient. The animation will be subtle and smooth, enhancing user experience.

**Explanation:**

* **`bg-gradient-to-r`**: This Tailwind class creates a linear gradient from left to right.
* **`from-blue-500 to-purple-500`**: This defines the starting and ending colors of the gradient.  Tailwind provides a wide range of pre-defined color palettes.
* **`hover:from-pink-500 hover:to-yellow-500`**:  These classes modify the gradient on hover, creating the animation.  The `hover:` prefix applies styles only when the mouse hovers over the button.
* **`text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg`**: These classes style the text color, font weight, padding, border radius, and shadow.
* **`transition duration-300 ease-in-out`**: This applies a smooth transition effect with a duration of 300 milliseconds and an ease-in-out timing function.
