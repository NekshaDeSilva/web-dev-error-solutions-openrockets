This document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with Next.js API routes:  properly handling asynchronous operations and ensuring data is fetched before sending a response.  Failing to do so can result in `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` or similar errors, where data you expect to be available is still undefined when the response is sent.

**Description of the Error:**

When fetching data from an external API or database within a Next.js API route,  if you attempt to process or return the data before the asynchronous operation completes, you'll encounter an error.  This is because the data might not yet be loaded when the `res.json()` or `res.send()` function is called.  The error message will vary depending on how you're attempting to use the data, but it often involves referencing properties of an object that hasn't been fully populated yet.  Common examples include `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` if you're trying to iterate over an array that's still `undefined`, or a similar error referencing other properties.

**Code (Problematic):**

```javascript
// pages/api/products.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products');
  const products = await data.json();

  // Incorrect: products might not be populated yet!
  res.json({ products: products.map(p => ({ ...p, price: p.price * 1.1 })) }); 
}
```


**Code (Fixed Step-by-Step):**

```javascript
// pages/api/products.js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  try {
    const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products');
    if (!data.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${data.status}`);
    }
    const products = await data.json();

    // Correct:  Wait for the data to be available before processing.
    const updatedProducts = products.map(p => ({ ...p, price: p.price * 1.1 }));
    res.status(200).json({ products: updatedProducts });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching products:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch products' });
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code had a race condition.  The `await` keyword pauses execution until the promise resolves, but the `res.json()` call was placed *before* the promise for `data.json()` had fully resolved. The corrected code uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the fetch operation. Crucially, it ensures that all `await` operations are completed before sending the response using `res.json()`. This prevents sending a response with undefined data. Error handling is added for a more robust API.  The use of type annotations (`NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`) enhances code readability and maintainability.
