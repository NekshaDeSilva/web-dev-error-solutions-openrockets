## Description of the Error

One common problem developers encounter in MongoDB is having too many indexes on a collection. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation, especially during write operations.  Each index consumes storage space and adds overhead during insert, update, and delete operations.  The insertion of new documents becomes slower, and the system might exhibit sluggish behavior overall.  Furthermore, excessive indexing can negatively impact query optimization, as the query planner might struggle to choose the most efficient index among numerous candidates.  This often manifests as slower-than-expected query performance, even with indexes present.

## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step

This example focuses on identifying and removing unnecessary compound indexes.  Let's assume we have a collection called `products` with multiple compound indexes that are no longer relevant or efficient.


**Step 1: Identify Unnecessary Indexes**

Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on the `products` collection.  Analyze the usage patterns of your application and determine which indexes are rarely or never used.  Indexes on rarely used fields significantly contribute to the problem.

```javascript
use yourDatabaseName; // Replace with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will output a JSON array detailing each index, including its name, keys, and other metadata.  Carefully examine the `key` field to understand what fields each index covers.


**Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Indexes**

Once you've identified unused or inefficient indexes, drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method. Replace `<index_name>` with the actual name of the index you want to remove. You can find the index name from the output of `db.collection.getIndexes()`.

```javascript
//Example: Dropping an index named 'myCompoundIndex'
db.products.dropIndex("myCompoundIndex")

//Example: Dropping an index on a specific field (MongoDB will find the index based on the field)
db.products.dropIndex({"category":1, "price":-1}) //drops index on category ASC and price DESC
```

**Step 3: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor the performance of your application. Use MongoDB's profiling features or performance monitoring tools to track query execution times and storage usage. This helps verify whether removing the indexes improved performance as expected.

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2) // Enable profiling level 2 (all operations)

// Perform typical operations on your collection

db.system.profile.find().sort({ts:-1}) // Review the profiling results

db.setProfilingLevel(0) //Disable profiling after monitoring
```


## Explanation

The core issue is a trade-off between query speed and write speed.  Indexes significantly speed up reads (queries) by creating sorted structures for specific fields.  However, each index adds overhead to write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) because MongoDB must update the index whenever a document is modified.   If you have many indexes, especially compound indexes on multiple fields, the write overhead can exceed the benefits of faster reads.  Removing unnecessary indexes reduces this overhead, leading to improved write performance. Remember that proper data modeling and well-chosen indexes are crucial for optimal MongoDB performance.  Over-indexing is a common pitfall to avoid.
