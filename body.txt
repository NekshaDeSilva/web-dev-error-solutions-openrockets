This document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing animation without JavaScript.  We'll use plain CSS3 for this example, but the concepts can be adapted to other CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

**Description of the Styling:**

The card starts in a compact state. When the user hovers over it, the card expands horizontally, revealing more content. The expansion is animated smoothly using a CSS transition.  We'll achieve this using the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `transform` property for scaling.

**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 5px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */
  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate it's interactive */
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scaleX(1.2); /* Expand horizontally on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h3>Hover Over Me!</h3>
    <p>This is some sample text that will appear when the card expands.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card element.  `width`, `height`, `background-color`, and `border-radius` define its appearance.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to keep the expanding content within the card's boundaries.  The `transition` property applies a smooth animation to the `transform` property, making the expansion look seamless.  `cursor: pointer` changes the cursor to a hand to indicate interactivity.

* **`.card:hover`:**  This pseudo-class targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `transform: scaleX(1.2)` scales the card horizontally by a factor of 1.2 (increasing its width by 20%).

* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content inside the card.
