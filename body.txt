This document addresses a common issue developers encounter in MongoDB: the performance degradation caused by having too many indexes.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an excessive number can lead to slower write operations and increased storage overhead.  This is particularly problematic in high-write environments.

**Description of the Error:**

The symptoms of having too many indexes manifest as slow insertion, update, and delete operations.  Your MongoDB instance might experience significant write latency, and the `mongostat` utility might reveal high write times and lock contention.  While read operations might initially appear fast due to the availability of many indexes, the overall system performance suffers due to the write bottleneck.  You might also notice increased storage usage due to the space consumed by redundant indexes.  There's no single error message explicitly stating "too many indexes," but the performance degradation itself is the indicator.

**Fixing Steps:**

This example assumes you're using the MongoDB shell.  Replace `<database_name>` and `<collection_name>` with your actual database and collection names.

**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes:**

First, list all indexes on your collection to understand the current indexing strategy:

```javascript
use <database_name>;
db.<collection_name>.getIndexes();
```

This command will output a JSON array of all indexes, including their keys, names, and properties.

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage:**

The next step involves analyzing the actual usage of each index.  The most effective method is to use the MongoDB profiler to identify which queries are using which indexes.  Enable the profiler (if not already enabled) and run your application for a period to gather data.  Then, analyze the profiler logs:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(2); // Enables profiling level 2 (all operations)
// Run your application...
db.system.profile.find({ millis: { $gt: 10 } }).sort({ ts: -1 }).limit(10) // Analyze profiling results, showing slow operations (adjust `millis` value as needed)

db.system.profile.drop(); // After analysis, disable the profiler
```

This will show which indexes are being used and for which queries.  Identify indexes that are not frequently used.  These are candidates for removal.


**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the profiler analysis, remove indexes that are not contributing significantly to query performance.  The `dropIndex` command removes a specific index:

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndex(<index_name>);  // Replace <index_name> with the index name.
```

For example, if you had an index named `_id_1`, you would run:

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndex("_id_1");
```

Alternatively, you can drop multiple indexes simultaneously using `dropIndexes`:

```javascript
db.<collection_name>.dropIndexes( [ "_id_1", "anotherIndex" ]);
```



**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing indexes, monitor your application's performance using `mongostat` or other monitoring tools to ensure that the removal has improved write performance without significantly impacting read performance.

**Explanation:**

Having too many indexes can lead to performance problems because each index requires extra storage space and incurs overhead during write operations.  Every write operation needs to update all indexes, which becomes exponentially slower as the number of indexes increases. Removing unnecessary indexes reduces this overhead and improves write performance.  It's crucial to carefully analyze index usage before removal to avoid negatively impacting query performance.  The profiler is your best friend for identifying underutilized indexes.
