This document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that, when hovered over, expands to reveal more content.  We'll use plain CSS for this example, but the concept can be easily adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

## Description of the Styling

The styling utilizes the `:hover` pseudo-class to trigger the expansion. The card starts with a compact size. On hover, the height increases to reveal hidden content, and a subtle transition makes the expansion smooth. We use flexbox for layout simplicity and control.


## Full Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Expanding Card</title>
<style>
.card {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */
  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Stack content vertically */
  width: 300px;
  height: 150px; /* Initial height */
}

.card:hover {
  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */
}

.card-content {
  padding: 15px;
}

.card-title {
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-text {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-content">
    <h2 class="card-title">Expanding Card</h2>
    <p class="card-text">This is some example text that will be hidden until you hover over the card. This effect is achieved entirely using CSS.  No JavaScript is needed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

## Explanation

* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from spilling outside the card's boundaries before expansion. `transition: height 0.3s ease;` creates the smooth animation when the height changes.  Flexbox (`display: flex; flex-direction: column;`) is used for easy vertical stacking of content.
* **`.card:hover`:** This targets the card when the mouse hovers over it, increasing the `height` property to reveal the hidden text.
* **`.card-content`, `.card-title`, `.card-text`:** These classes provide basic styling for the content inside the card.
