## Description of the Error

A common problem encountered in MongoDB is the creation of too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up queries, an excessive number can lead to performance degradation.  This is because each index consumes disk space, and more importantly, every write operation (insert, update, delete) requires updating *all* affected indexes.  With numerous indexes, write operations become significantly slower, impacting overall database performance. This is often seen as slowed application response times, especially during periods of high write activity.  The MongoDB profiler might highlight slow `insert`, `update`, or `delete` operations as a result.

## Code Example and Fixing Steps (Illustrative)

This example uses the Node.js driver, but the principle applies to any driver.  Assume we have a collection named 'products' with the following schema:

```json
{
  "name": String,
  "category": String,
  "price": Number,
  "description": String,
  "tags": [String]
}
```

Let's say we've created indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, and `tags`, and performance is suffering.  We need to carefully analyze index usage and remove redundant or rarely used ones.

**Step 1: Analyze Index Usage (using the MongoDB Compass or `db.collection.getIndexes()`):**

First, we need to identify which indexes are underperforming or unnecessary.  We can use the MongoDB Compass GUI or run the following command directly in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes on the `products` collection, including their usage statistics (which will vary depending on the tools used). This is the crucial step to identify unused or inefficient indexes.

**Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

Based on the analysis, let's say the index on `description` is rarely used and the index on `tags` is causing significant write overhead (possibly due to the array type requiring more complex indexing). We'll remove them:

```javascript
// Using the MongoDB shell
db.products.dropIndex("description_1") //Assuming "description_1" is the index name
db.products.dropIndex({ tags: 1}) //Removes the index on the tags field
```

**Step 3: Optimize Remaining Indexes (if needed):**

Sometimes, an index might be good for a certain query but less so for others.  We might need to rethink our indexing strategy. For example, a compound index could perform better than multiple single-field indexes. For the `products` collection, a compound index on `category` and `price` might be beneficial if we often query for products within a specific category and price range:


```javascript
// Using the MongoDB shell
db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
```

**Step 4: Monitor Performance:**

After removing or modifying indexes, monitor the performance of your application closely.  Use the MongoDB profiler or your application's logging to track the impact of these changes.  You may need to iterate on this process, adjusting indexes based on your observations.

## Explanation

The "Too Many Indexes" problem highlights the trade-off between read and write performance in MongoDB.  While indexes drastically improve read query speeds, each index adds overhead to write operations.  An excessive number of indexes, especially if they are rarely used or are redundant, causes significant performance bottlenecks.  Effective index management involves careful planning, analysis of query patterns, and iterative adjustments based on performance monitoring.
