This document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Response already sent` error. This error typically arises when you attempt to modify the response object multiple times within the same middleware function, leading to conflicts and preventing Next.js from correctly serving the request.

**Description of the Error:**

The `Response already sent` error in Next.js Middleware signifies that a response has already been committed to the client before your middleware function attempted to further modify it.  This often happens when you have multiple `res.redirect()` calls, multiple `res.end()` calls, or a combination of both within a single middleware function, or when combining middleware with other response-modifying methods.  The browser receives the initial response, and any subsequent attempts to change it are ignored, resulting in this error.


**Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix:**

Let's consider a scenario where we have middleware intended to redirect users to the `/login` page if they are not authenticated.  The flawed implementation might look like this:

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    // Incorrect: This will cause 'Response already sent' error if other modifications are attempted later.
    res.redirect('/login') 
    //Other logic that might throw error
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/', //this matcher specifies that this middleware will run on the root path only.
};
```

**Step 1: Identify Conflicting Response Modifications:**

The problem lies in the fact that the middleware attempts to perform other operations after `res.redirect('/login')`.  This creates the conflict.


**Step 2: Use `NextResponse` consistently:**

The correct approach involves using `NextResponse` consistently for all response manipulations within the middleware function.

```javascript
// pages/api/middleware.js
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/',
};
```


**Step 3: Employ Conditional Logic Effectively:**

Ensure that only one response modification occurs.  Use `if` statements or other control flow mechanisms to ensure that you only execute a single `NextResponse` method per middleware function execution.


**Explanation:**

The `NextResponse` object provides methods for creating and modifying responses in a controlled manner.  Using `NextResponse.redirect()` returns a proper response object; whereas `res.redirect()` operates directly on the underlying response object and is incompatible with other modifications within a middleware function.  The `new URL('/login', req.url)` creates a correctly formatted URL object to ensure that the redirect works properly with different request paths.
