This document details how to create a circular progress bar using only CSS.  We'll leverage CSS's `conic-gradient` function for a clean and efficient solution. This technique avoids the need for JavaScript or external libraries, making it lightweight and performant.

**Description of the Styling:**

The progress bar consists of a circle divided into two parts: a filled segment representing the progress and an empty segment. We use `conic-gradient` to create this division. The `conic-gradient` function takes angles as arguments, allowing us to precisely control the filled portion's size based on a percentage.  We also use some basic CSS for sizing, positioning, and visual enhancements.


**Full Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CSS Circular Progress Bar</title>
<style>
.progress-ring {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.progress-ring::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  width: 130px;
  height: 130px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: conic-gradient(
    #4CAF50 70%, /* Green fill, adjust percentage for progress */
    #f0f0f0 70%  /* Gray empty part */
  );
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Circular Progress Bar (70%)</h1>
<div class="progress-ring">
  <div>70%</div> </div>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

* **`.progress-ring`**: This class styles the main container, setting its size, shape (circle using `border-radius`), background color, and centering the inner percentage display using flexbox.

* **`.progress-ring::before`**: This pseudo-element creates the circular progress bar itself. It's positioned absolutely within the parent container, slightly smaller to create a border effect.  The `conic-gradient` is the key:

    * `#4CAF50 70%`: This sets the first color (green) to fill 70% of the circle.  Change this percentage to adjust the progress.
    * `#f0f0f0 70%`: This sets the remaining portion to light gray. The `70%` here is crucial; it determines where the transition between the colors happens.
