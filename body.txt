This document addresses a common problem faced by developers when building APIs with Node.js and Express.js: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.  These errors occur when a web application (e.g., a React frontend) tries to make requests to an API hosted on a different domain, protocol, or port.  Browsers, for security reasons, restrict these cross-origin requests unless the server explicitly allows them.

**Description of the Error:**

When a CORS error occurs, you'll typically see an error message in your browser's developer console similar to:

`Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'your-api-url' from origin 'your-frontend-url' has been blocked by CORS policy:`

This indicates that your frontend application isn't authorized to access the API endpoint.

**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**

The solution involves configuring your Express.js server to allow cross-origin requests from your frontend.  Here's how you can do it using the `cors` middleware package:

**1. Install the `cors` package:**

```bash
npm install cors
```

**2.  Implement CORS middleware in your Express.js server:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();
const port = 3001; // or your desired port

// Middleware to enable CORS
app.use(cors()); // This allows all origins.  See below for more restrictive options.
app.use(express.json()); // for parsing application/json

// Your API routes
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from the API!' });
});


app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

**3.  More Restrictive CORS Configuration (Recommended):**

For production environments, it's crucial to restrict CORS access to only your frontend's origin.  This prevents unauthorized access to your API.  Modify the `cors` middleware like this:

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000', // Replace with your frontend's URL
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200, // some legacy browsers choke on 204
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

Replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with the actual URL of your frontend application.  If you're deploying to a different environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel), update this URL accordingly. You might need to use a wildcard like `*.yourdomain.com` if your frontend is deployed across multiple subdomains.


**Explanation:**

The `cors()` middleware from the `cors` package intercepts incoming requests and adds the necessary HTTP headers to the response, allowing the browser to bypass the CORS restrictions.  The `origin` option specifies which origins are allowed to access the API.  `optionsSuccessStatus: 200` ensures compatibility with older browsers.
