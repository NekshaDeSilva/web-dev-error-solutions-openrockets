**Description of the Error:**

One common problem developers encounter in MongoDB is having too many indexes. While indexes significantly speed up query performance, an excessive number can lead to several issues:

* **Write performance degradation:**  Every write operation (insert, update, delete) needs to update all relevant indexes.  Too many indexes slow down these write operations significantly.
* **Increased storage overhead:**  Indexes consume disk space. Many indexes mean a larger database footprint.
* **Query planner confusion:** The query planner might struggle to choose the optimal index amongst a multitude of options, potentially leading to suboptimal query execution plans.

This situation often manifests as slow write speeds and potentially higher storage costs, without a proportional improvement in read performance.

**Scenario:** Let's imagine a collection called `products` with fields like `name`, `category`, `price`, and `manufacturer`.  A developer, aiming for optimal query performance, might create indexes on `name`, `category`, `price`, `manufacturer`, and potentially various combinations (e.g., `{"category": 1, "price": 1}`).  Without careful consideration, this leads to excessive indexing.

**Fixing Step-by-Step (Code and Explanation):**

1. **Identify Excess Indexes:**

   The first step is to identify unnecessary or redundant indexes. Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` command to list all indexes on the `products` collection:

   ```javascript
   use your_database_name; // Replace your_database_name with your database name
   db.products.getIndexes()
   ```

   This will return a JSON array of index specifications. Analyze this output.  Look for indexes that are rarely used (based on your application's query patterns), indexes that are subsets of other compound indexes (redundant), or indexes on fields rarely used in `$query` operations.

2. **Analyze Query Performance:**

   Use MongoDB's profiling capabilities (turn on profiling with `db.setProfilingLevel(2)`) and examine the `system.profile` collection to analyze the query performance.  Identify which queries are slow and which indexes are being (or not being) used.  This provides data-driven insights into index usage.

   ```javascript
   db.setProfilingLevel(2) //Start Profiling Level 2 (all operations)
   // ... run your application queries ...
   db.system.profile.find({millis: {$gt: 10}}) //Find queries that took longer than 10ms
   db.system.profile.drop(); //Drop the profiling collection to free up space
   ```

3. **Remove Unnecessary Indexes:**

   Based on steps 1 and 2, identify indexes that are not providing significant performance gains but contribute to the problem.  Use the `db.collection.dropIndex()` command to remove them. For example, to drop an index on the `manufacturer` field:

   ```javascript
   db.products.dropIndex("manufacturer_1") //Replace with the actual index name
   ```

   **Important:** Always back up your data before making significant index changes.

4. **Optimize Existing Indexes:**

   Sometimes, you don't need to remove indexes; you can optimize them. For example, consider compound indexes.  If you have separate indexes on `category` and `price`, a compound index on `{"category": 1, "price": 1}` might be more efficient and replace both.

   ```javascript
   db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: 1 } )
   ```

5. **Monitor Performance:**

   After removing or optimizing indexes, monitor your application's performance closely. Use tools like MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB shell to observe query execution times and write performance.  Iteratively adjust your indexes based on your observations.

**Explanation:**

The key to effective indexing is to balance read performance improvements with the potential impact on write performance.  Avoid creating indexes on every field.  Focus on fields frequently used in query filters (`$query`) and sorting (`$sort`) operations.  Use compound indexes strategically to combine multiple fields. Regular review and optimization of your indexes are crucial for maintaining a well-performing MongoDB database.
