This document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating the Video.js HTML5 video player into responsive web designs: the player's height not adjusting correctly to maintain aspect ratio when the browser window is resized. This often results in distorted video playback or excessive letterboxing/pillarboxing.

**Description of the Error:**

The Video.js player, by default, doesn't automatically resize to maintain its aspect ratio when the browser window or its container's dimensions change.  This leads to the video appearing stretched or with large black bars, ruining the viewing experience.  The issue is particularly noticeable in responsive layouts where the container's width changes dynamically.

**Code: Step-by-step fix**

This solution utilizes CSS and JavaScript to ensure the Video.js player maintains its aspect ratio. We'll adjust the height dynamically based on the width.

**1. HTML Structure:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Video.js Responsive Example</title>
  <link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    #my-video {
      width: 100%; /* Crucial for responsive behavior */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <video id="my-video" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="640" height="360"
         poster="poster.jpg" data-setup="{}">
    <source src="my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <p class="vjs-no-js">
      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
      web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a>
    </p>
  </video>
  <script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    // JavaScript for dynamic height adjustment (explained below)
    const video = videojs('my-video');
    video.on('loadedmetadata', function() {
      const aspectRatio = this.videoWidth / this.videoHeight;
      const containerWidth = this.el().offsetWidth;
      this.el().style.height = (containerWidth / aspectRatio) + 'px';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**2. Explanation:**

* **HTML:**  The `<video>` tag includes the necessary Video.js classes.  Crucially, we set `width: 100%;` in the CSS to ensure the player takes up the full available width of its container.  The `poster` attribute shows an image before the video starts.  Remember to replace `"my-video.mp4"` and `"poster.jpg"` with your actual video and poster image URLs.
* **JavaScript:** The core logic lies in the JavaScript.
    * `videojs('my-video')` gets a reference to the Video.js player instance.
    * `on('loadedmetadata', function(){...})` ensures the code runs after the video metadata (including dimensions) has been loaded.
    * `this.videoWidth / this.videoHeight` calculates the video's aspect ratio.
    * `this.el().offsetWidth` gets the player's current width.
    * `this.el().style.height` dynamically sets the height based on the calculated aspect ratio and width. This keeps the aspect ratio consistent, regardless of the container's width.

**Explanation of the Solution:**

This approach ensures the video player always maintains its correct aspect ratio, preventing distortion.  The key is setting the `width` to `100%` and then calculating and setting the `height` dynamically based on the aspect ratio once the video metadata is available.  This makes the player fully responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
