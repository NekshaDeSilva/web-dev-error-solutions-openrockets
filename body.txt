## Description of the Error

Over-indexing in MongoDB, while seemingly beneficial for query performance, can significantly hinder write operations and overall database performance.  Adding too many indexes increases the storage space required, slows down `insert`, `update`, and `delete` operations (because indexes need to be updated as well), and can even lead to performance degradation on read operations if not carefully planned. The database spends more time managing indexes than executing queries. This is especially problematic with high-write workloads.  Instead of speeding things up, excessive indexing can create a bottleneck.


## Fixing Step-by-Step

This example demonstrates how to identify and address over-indexing on a collection named "products" with several unnecessary indexes.


**Step 1: Identify Existing Indexes**

First, we list all existing indexes on the `products` collection using the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
use myDatabase; // Replace myDatabase with your database name
db.products.getIndexes()
```

This will return a list of all indexes, including their keys and options.  Let's assume the output shows multiple indexes that are redundant or rarely used.  For example:

```json
[
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "_id": 1 },
    "name": "_id_"
  },
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "category": 1, "price": 1 },
    "name": "category_1_price_1"
  },
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "name": 1 },
    "name": "name_1"
  },
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "price": 1 },
    "name": "price_1"
  },
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "description": "text" },
    "name": "description_text"
  },
  {
    "v": 2,
    "key": { "sku": 1 },
    "name": "sku_1"
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Analyze Index Usage**

MongoDB provides tools to analyze index usage. For detailed information, we use the `db.collection.stats()` method:

```javascript
db.products.stats()
```

This provides information including the number of indexes, their size, and their usage statistics.  Look for indexes with low usage.

**Step 3: Drop Redundant or Unused Indexes**

Based on the analysis, let's assume the `name_1` and `price_1` indexes are redundant (because we have a more comprehensive `category_1_price_1` index and we rarely query by `name` alone).  We'll drop them using the `db.collection.dropIndex()` method:


```javascript
db.products.dropIndex("name_1");
db.products.dropIndex("price_1");
```


**Step 4: Monitor Performance**

After dropping indexes, monitor the performance of your application.  Use MongoDB's profiling tools or your application's performance monitoring to assess the impact of the changes.  You might consider using slow query logs to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.


## Explanation

Over-indexing impacts write performance because every write operation requires updating all relevant indexes.  Read performance can also be negatively affected if the overhead of managing numerous indexes outweighs their benefits in query optimization.  Careful index selection, based on frequent queries and query patterns, is crucial. The `explain()` method on queries can help determine which indexes are actually being used.
