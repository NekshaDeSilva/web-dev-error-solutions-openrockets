[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when developing API routes in Next.js:  `Error: Response already sent`. This error typically occurs when you attempt to send multiple responses from a single API route handler.  Next.js's API routes are designed to send a single response per request.  Sending multiple responses, even seemingly innocuous ones like logging messages or redirects *after* the main response, will trigger this error.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Error: Response already sent` error in Next.js API routes indicates that your server-side function has already committed a response to the client, yet it's attempting to send another response. This usually stems from inadvertently sending multiple responses or from asynchronous operations completing after the primary response has been sent.\n\n\n**Code Example and Fix (Step-by-Step):**\n\nLet's say we have an API route that fetches data from a database and logs the request to a monitoring service:\n\n**Problematic Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/data.js\nimport { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const client = await MongoClient.connect('YOUR_MONGODB_URI');\n  const db = client.db('yourDatabase');\n  const collection = db.collection('yourCollection');\n\n  const data = await collection.find({}).toArray();\n  res.status(200).json(data); // First response\n\n  console.log('Request processed:', req.method, req.url); // Second (implicit) response attempt - causes error!\n  client.close();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will fail because `console.log` (indirectly) tries to send a response *after* `res.status(200).json(data)` has already completed the initial response.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/data.js\nimport { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const client = await MongoClient.connect('YOUR_MONGODB_URI');\n  const db = client.db('yourDatabase');\n  const collection = db.collection('yourCollection');\n\n  try {\n    const data = await collection.find({}).toArray();\n    res.status(200).json(data);  // Send the primary response\n\n    console.log('Request processed:', req.method, req.url); // Now safe, after the response is sent.\n    \n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error processing request:', error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' }); // Handle errors gracefully\n  } finally {\n    await client.close(); //Ensure connection is closed regardless of success or failure\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe key change is moving the `console.log` statement *after* the main response (`res.status(200).json(data);`). The logging now occurs after the response has been fully sent to the client, avoiding the conflict. The `try...catch...finally` block is added for robust error handling and to guarantee database connection closure.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction): The official Next.js documentation on API routes.\n* [Node.js `res.end()` Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_end_data_encoding_callback) (Illustrative): While not directly related to Next.js, understanding how `res.end()` signals response completion is helpful.  The concept is the same.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** If you have other asynchronous operations (e.g., sending emails, updating caches), ensure they're handled correctly. Promises and `async/await` are your best friends here.\n* **Error Handling:**  Always include robust error handling (as shown in the corrected example) to gracefully handle potential issues and prevent unexpected responses.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
