[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The effect involves a card that smoothly expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  We'll achieve this using CSS transitions and transformations. This technique is suitable for various projects and requires no JavaScript.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts with a fixed height, displaying only a title and a small preview. On hover, the card's height expands to reveal more content hidden beneath.  A subtle visual cue, a slight shadow change, is also added to enhance the user experience.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the initial height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height and shadow */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-description {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card Example</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-description\">This is a short preview of the card content.  Hover over the card to see the full content expand.</p>\n    <p class=\"card-description\">This is the hidden content that will be revealed on hover. You can add more text or other elements here as needed.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;`**: This line is crucial. It defines a smooth transition for both the `height` and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease\" timing function.  This creates the smooth expanding and shadow animation.\n\n* **`height: 100px;` and `height: 300px;`**: These set the initial and expanded heights of the card, respectively. Adjust these values to suit your design.\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the hidden content from overflowing the initial card height before the hover effect.\n\n* **`box-shadow`**:  This property creates a subtle shadow, enhancing the 3D effect. The values are adjusted on hover to provide a more pronounced shadow, further emphasizing the expansion.\n\n* **The HTML Structure:** The HTML uses simple divs to structure the card, title, and description.  You can easily customize the content within the `.card-content` div.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
