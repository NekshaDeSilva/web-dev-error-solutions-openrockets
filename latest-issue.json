[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth and visually appealing animation.  This example is achievable with plain CSS3, though similar effects can be more easily styled with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe styling creates a card that expands vertically when hovered over. The expansion is accompanied by a subtle opacity change on the card's content, creating a sense of depth and revealing the content gradually.  The card itself uses a simple box-shadow for visual enhancement.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content overflow during expansion */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 200px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  opacity: 0.8; /* Initial opacity */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth opacity transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Full opacity on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">My Expanding Card</h3>\n    <p>This is some example text inside the card.  It will smoothly appear as you hover over the card.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card element.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from overflowing during the expansion. The `transition` property defines smooth animations for height and opacity.  The initial height is set to 100px.\n\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector applies styles when the mouse hovers over the card.  The height is increased to 200px on hover.\n\n* **`.card-content`**: Styles the inner content of the card. The initial `opacity` is set to 0.8, creating a subtle fade-in effect.  The `transition` property ensures a smooth opacity change.\n\n* **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This targets the `.card-content` element *only* when the parent `.card` is hovered over,  changing the opacity to 1 (fully visible).\n\n\n## External References\n\nWhile there isn't a single definitive article on this specific effect, many resources cover CSS transitions and transforms.
