[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only technique for creating an expanding card element with a smooth, subtle reveal animation.  No JavaScript is required. The animation uses CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a visually appealing effect.  This example uses plain CSS, but the principles can be easily adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis style creates a card that, on hover, expands slightly, revealing a hidden portion of its content.  The expansion is coupled with a subtle fade-in effect on the revealed content.  The overall effect is clean, modern, and interactive without needing any JavaScript.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* subtle shadow */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Fade-in transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Fully visible on hover */\n}\n\n.hidden-content {\n  opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden; /* hides the content initially */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover .hidden-content {\n  opacity: 1;\n  height: auto; /* Reveal on hover */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is the visible card content.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"hidden-content\">\n    <p>This content is initially hidden and reveals on hover.</p>\n    <p>More hidden content can be added here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:**  This is crucial for the animation. It smoothly transitions the `transform` (scale) and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`transform: scale(1.05)`:** This scales the card up slightly on hover, creating the expansion effect.\n* **`opacity` and `height` transitions:** These control the fade-in and height changes of the hidden content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is vital to prevent the initially hidden content from affecting the layout before the hover effect.\n* **Class Structure:**  The use of separate classes (`card-content` and `hidden-content`) allows for targeted styling of the visible and hidden parts of the card.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
