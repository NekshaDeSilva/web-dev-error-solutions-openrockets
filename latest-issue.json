[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common error encountered when working with Video.js is `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'currentTime')`. This typically arises when trying to access the `currentTime` property of a Video.js player instance before the player has fully initialized or loaded the video.  This means your code attempts to read the `currentTime` before the video player object is ready.\n\n## Steps to Fix the Error\n\nThis error usually indicates a timing issue where you're trying to access the player before it's ready. The solution involves ensuring that your code executes *after* the player has been initialized and the video metadata is loaded.  We'll use the `ready` event provided by Video.js.\n\n**Step 1: Include Video.js**\n\nFirst, ensure that you've correctly included the Video.js library in your HTML file.  This typically involves adding a `<script>` tag linking to the Video.js CDN or a local copy.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Video.js Example</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.min.js\"></script>\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body>\n\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js vjs-big-play-centered\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\n         poster=\"poster.png\" data-setup='{\"sources\": [{\"src\": \"my-video.mp4\", \"type\": \"video/mp4\"}]}'>\n    <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">\n      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a\n      web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a>\n    </p>\n  </video>\n\n  <script>\n    // Our fix will go here\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Step 2: Use the `ready` event**\n\nInstead of directly accessing `player.currentTime` immediately, wait for the `ready` event.  This event fires when the player is fully initialized and ready to use.\n\n```javascript\nvar player = videojs('my-video');\n\nplayer.ready(function(){\n  console.log(\"Player is ready!\");\n  console.log(\"Current time:\", this.currentTime()); //Access currentTime here\n\n  // Add event listeners or perform other actions here\n  this.on('timeupdate', function() {\n      console.log(\"Current Time Updated:\", this.currentTime());\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `ready` event ensures that your code runs only after the Video.js player has finished loading and is ready to interact with.  Attempting to access `currentTime` before the player is initialized leads to the `undefined` error because the player object isn't fully formed yet.  The `this` keyword inside the `ready` callback refers to the Video.js player instance.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Video.js Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)  (Look for their documentation on events and player initialization)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
