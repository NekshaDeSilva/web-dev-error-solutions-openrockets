[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required!  This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to smoothly expand a card when the user's mouse hovers over it.  We'll use plain CSS for simplicity, but the concept can easily be adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will have a base state with a certain width and height. Upon hovering, the card will smoothly expand to a larger width and height.  We'll also add a subtle shadow for visual enhancement.  The transition will be applied to the `transform` property (for scaling) and the `box-shadow` property for a more polished effect.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```css\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content overflow during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand by 10% */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\n**HTML Structure (Example):**\n\nTo use the CSS, you'll need some basic HTML:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>Some card content goes here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class defines the base styles for the card, including its size, background color, border radius, and initial box shadow.  The `transition` property is crucial; it specifies that the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties should smoothly transition over 0.3 seconds when their values change.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from spilling outside the card during expansion.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This pseudo-class applies styles *only* when the mouse hovers over the element with the class `.card`. The `transform: scale(1.1);` increases the card's size by 10% in both dimensions. The `box-shadow` is also increased to create a more pronounced shadow effect.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** Search for \"CSS hover effects\" on [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) for more advanced examples and techniques.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
