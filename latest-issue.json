[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when working with Next.js API routes: exceeding the request timeout limit when processing large datasets or performing computationally intensive operations.  This can lead to incomplete responses or outright errors in your application.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen an API route takes longer to execute than the server's configured timeout (typically around 60 seconds), the request will be terminated, resulting in a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This is particularly problematic when dealing with substantial data processing, database queries, or external API calls.  The client will receive an error, preventing them from accessing the necessary data.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis example demonstrates handling a large response from a database query by implementing streaming.  We'll assume a hypothetical scenario where we're retrieving a large number of products from a database.\n\n**Problem Code (Illustrative):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const products = await getAllProductsFromDatabase(); // This might take a long time\n  res.status(200).json(products);\n}\n```\n\n**Solution Code (with streaming):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products.js\nimport { pipeline } from 'stream/promises';\nimport { Readable } from 'stream';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n    const products = await getAllProductsFromDatabase();\n\n    // Create a readable stream from the array of products\n    const productStream = new Readable({\n        objectMode: true,\n        async pull(controller) {\n            if (products.length === 0) {\n                controller.close();\n                return;\n            }\n            controller.push(products.shift());\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Set headers to indicate streaming JSON\n    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n    res.setHeader('Transfer-Encoding', 'chunked'); // Important for streaming\n\n    // Use pipeline to stream data to the response\n    try {\n        await pipeline(productStream, res);\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.error('Pipeline failed.', err);\n        res.status(500).end();\n    }\n}\n\n//Helper function (replace with your database interaction)\nasync function getAllProductsFromDatabase() {\n    // Simulate fetching a large number of products\n    const products = [];\n    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {\n        products.push({ id: i, name: `Product ${i}` });\n    }\n    return products;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Import `pipeline` and `Readable`:** These are essential for creating and managing streams.\n2. **Create a `Readable` stream:** This stream iterates through the `products` array and pushes each product to the response one by one.  `objectMode: true` is crucial for sending JSON objects.\n3. **Set headers:** `Content-Type` specifies JSON, and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` signals to the client that the response will be streamed in chunks, preventing timeouts.\n4. **Use `pipeline`:** This function efficiently handles streaming data from the `productStream` to the response.  The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during streaming.\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Node.js Streams Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)\n* [Handling Large Files in Node.js](https://blog.logrocket.com/handling-large-files-in-nodejs/)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
