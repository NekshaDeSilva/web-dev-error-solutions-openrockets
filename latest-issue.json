[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: rate limits.  Discord implements rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of its service.  Exceeding these limits results in errors, preventing your bot from functioning correctly.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen your bot sends messages, edits messages, or performs other actions too frequently, Discord will respond with a rate limit error. This typically manifests as a HTTP error code (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) or an error within the Discord.js library indicating a rate limit has been reached.  The bot will temporarily cease functioning until the rate limit window expires.  Ignoring these limits can lead to your bot being temporarily or permanently banned from the Discord API.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle rate limits using `async/await` and promises, providing a clean and robust solution:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nasync function sendMessageWithRateLimit(channel, message) {\n  try {\n    const msg = await channel.send(message);\n    console.log(\"Message sent successfully!\");\n    return msg;\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.code === 50013) { //Missing Access\n        console.error(\"Bot lacks permission in this channel.\");\n        return null;\n    }\n    if (error.code === 429) {\n      const retryAfter = error.retryAfter || 1000; // Default retry after 1 second\n      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying after ${retryAfter / 1000} seconds...`);\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter));\n      return sendMessageWithRateLimit(channel, message); // Recursive call\n    }\n    console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {\n  if (message.content === '!test') {\n    await sendMessageWithRateLimit(message.channel, 'This message was sent using rate limit handling!');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`sendMessageWithRateLimit(channel, message)` function:** This function encapsulates the message sending logic.  It uses `async/await` for cleaner error handling.\n\n2. **`try...catch` block:** This handles potential errors, specifically focusing on HTTP error code 429 (Too Many Requests).\n\n3. **Rate Limit Handling:** If a 429 error is caught, the code extracts the `retryAfter` value from the error object (in milliseconds). If it doesn't exist, it defaults to 1000ms (1 second).  A `setTimeout` promise delays execution, allowing the bot to wait before retrying.\n\n4. **Recursive Call:** The function recursively calls itself after the delay. This ensures that the message is sent eventually, even if multiple rate limits are encountered.  Be mindful of infinite recursion, ensuring your conditions for retry are accurate and won't result in an infinite loop.\n\n5. **Error Handling for Missing Permissions**: The code now also handles the case where the bot lacks permission to send messages in a channel (error code 50013).\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Discord.js Guide](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome): Official Discord.js documentation.\n* [Discord API Rate Limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits): Discord's documentation on rate limits.\n\n**Note:** Replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token.  Ensure you have the necessary intents enabled in your Discord application settings.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
