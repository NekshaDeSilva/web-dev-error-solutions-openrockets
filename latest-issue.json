[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `headers already sent` error. This typically occurs when you try to modify response headers after data has already been sent to the client. This is often a subtle issue, making it challenging to debug.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error in Next.js Middleware signifies that your middleware function has attempted to modify response headers (e.g., using `res.setHeader()`, `res.writeHead()`, or implicitly through setting cookies) after the response body has begun being sent to the client.  This usually happens when you have inadvertently written something to the response before attempting to set headers, often by logging to the console or accidentally rendering something.  The browser receives the partial response, and the server attempts a second send of headers, resulting in the error.\n\n\n**Code Example (Problem):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/route.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  console.log(\"Request received:\", req.method); // THIS LINE CAUSES THE ERROR\n  res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'MyValue');\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World' });\n}\n\n// pages/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.url.startsWith('/api')) {\n    // If we are attempting to modify headers here, the console log\n    // in the API route will already have sent headers causing an error\n      res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/api/:path*']\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `console.log` statement in the API route (`pages/api/route.js`) sends data to the client *before* the middleware in `pages/middleware.js` attempts to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, causing the `headers already sent` error.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Identify the Culprit:** Carefully examine your API route and middleware functions.  Look for any unintended calls that write to the response before headers are set.  Common offenders are:\n   * `console.log()` statements within the API route's main function body, *especially when not using Next.js' built-in logger*.\n   * Accidental rendering of HTML or other content before setting headers.\n   * Unhandled errors that write to the response before error handling.\n   * Asynchronous operations that complete after some response data has already been sent.\n\n\n2. **Remove or Fix Premature Writes:** Remove or correct the code causing the premature response data. In the example above, we will remove the `console.log` statement.\n\n\n3. **Order Operations Correctly:** Ensure that all header modifications happen *before* any data is written to the response.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/route.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // Removed the console.log statement\n  res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'MyValue');\n  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello World' });\n}\n\n// pages/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.url.startsWith('/api')) {\n    const response = NextResponse.next();\n    response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');\n    return response;\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/api/:path*']\n};\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, we've removed the `console.log` statement. Importantly, we are using `NextResponse` instead of the older `res` object for more consistent response handling in both API routes and middleware. This helps avoid the `headers already sent` error, as `NextResponse` is designed to handle header and body management efficiently, and guarantees headers are set before the body is sent.\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error is a fundamental HTTP constraint.  Once the server begins sending the response body, it can't go back and change the headers.  Next.js Middleware operates in a similar manner: if you attempt to alter headers after some data has already been transmitted, the error will occur.  Using NextResponse ensures that these operations occur in the correct sequence and avoids this problem altogether.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
