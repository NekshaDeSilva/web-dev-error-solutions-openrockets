[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common issue when working with Next.js Middleware is unexpected behavior when manipulating the `request.nextUrl.pathname` property.  Specifically,  modifications made to `request.nextUrl.pathname` might not always reflect the actual URL the user ends up on. This often happens when redirecting or rewriting URLs, especially within nested middleware functions or when interacting with other features like rewrites in the `next.config.js` file.  The problem manifests as redirects or rewrites failing to work as intended, leading to users ending up on incorrect pages or experiencing unexpected routing behavior. This inconsistency arises from the way Next.js handles URL manipulation during the middleware execution phase and the subsequent rendering phase.\n\n\n## Code Example: Fixing the Issue\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we want to redirect all requests to `/blog` to `/articles` using middleware.  A naive approach might fail to work correctly:\n\n\n**Incorrect Approach:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/blog') {\n    req.nextUrl.pathname = '/articles';\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/articles', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/blog/*'],\n};\n```\n\nThis code *appears* correct, but the rewrite may not function as intended due to the way Next.js processes the URL. Modifying `req.nextUrl` in place doesn't guarantee the change propagates correctly through the middleware pipeline.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\nThe correct way is to create a new `URL` object and use that with the `NextResponse.rewrite()` or `NextResponse.redirect()` methods. This ensures that Next.js correctly handles the URL change.\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/blog') {\n    const newUrl = new URL('/articles', req.url); // Create a new URL object\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(newUrl); // Use the new URL object\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/blog/*'],\n};\n```\n\n\nThis corrected version creates a completely new URL object, avoiding potential inconsistencies. Next.js will then correctly handle the redirection.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core reason why the first example fails is that modifying `req.nextUrl.pathname` directly doesn't always trigger a full URL update within the Next.js routing system.  By creating a new `URL` object with `new URL('/articles', req.url)`, we're explicitly telling Next.js to create a new URL object with the desired path, preserving the existing origin and other properties. This guarantees that the rewrite or redirect is processed correctly throughout the entire middleware and rendering process.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
