[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the dreaded \"Error: headers already sent\" message. This usually happens when you try to modify the response headers after some content has already been sent to the client.  This can be particularly tricky because the error doesn't always pinpoint the exact location of the issue within your middleware.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Error: headers already sent` error in Next.js Middleware means your code attempted to set or modify HTTP headers after the response body has already started being sent to the client. This typically happens because you have some output (e.g., `console.log`, accidental whitespace, or even a stray character) *before* your `next()` call within the middleware.  This prevents the middleware from correctly modifying headers, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.\n\n**Scenario:**  Let's imagine a middleware that redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.  A common mistake is to include unintended output *before* calling `next()`.\n\n\n**Faulty Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  console.log(\"This will cause the error!\") //Unintentional output before next()\n  const session = req.cookies.get('session');\n\n  if (!session) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Identify the culprit:** Carefully examine your middleware code *before* the `next()` or `NextResponse` function call. Look for any unintentional output, including:\n    * `console.log` statements\n    * Unintended whitespace or characters (even a single space or newline)\n    * Errors or exceptions that might be logging to the console\n\n2. **Remove or fix the pre-mature output:** In our example, the `console.log` statement is the problem. Simply remove it:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (Corrected)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const session = req.cookies.get('session');\n\n  if (!session) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n3. **Ensure Proper `return` Statements:** Always ensure that your middleware function has a `return` statement.  If you don't return anything, implicit output might occur, triggering the error.  Explicitly return `NextResponse.next()` if you don't want to modify the response.\n\n4. **Check for Errors:** If you have any `try...catch` blocks in your middleware, make sure any errors within the `try` block are handled appropriately without unintended output (like logging to the console within the `catch` block).\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nNext.js middleware operates in a specific order.  It intercepts requests before they reach your pages. If the middleware function produces any output before the `NextResponse` object is returned, the response headers are implicitly closed. Any subsequent attempt to change headers results in the `headers already sent` error. By removing unnecessary output or ensuring a clean `return` statement, you prevent this premature header closure.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Handling Errors in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#handling-errors)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
