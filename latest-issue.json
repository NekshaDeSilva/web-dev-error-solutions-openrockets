[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Headers already sent` error.  This error typically arises when you attempt to modify the HTTP response headers after they've already been sent to the client.  This often happens due to unintended multiple calls to `next.NextResponse.redirect` or similar methods.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Headers already sent` error in Next.js middleware manifests as a server-side error. You'll see an error message similar to this in your logs:  `Headers already sent` or `Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client`. This indicates that your middleware function is attempting to modify the response headers after the response has begun to be sent to the browser.  This usually prevents the page from loading correctly.\n\n\n## Code Example & Fix:  Incorrect Middleware\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we want to redirect users to a login page if they're not authenticated.  Here's an example of middleware code that *incorrectly* handles this, leading to the `Headers already sent` error:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    // Incorrect - multiple redirects can cause the error\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url)); // Another redirect attempt\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // Match routes starting with /protected\n};\n```\n\nThis code attempts *two* redirects.  The first `NextResponse.redirect` already sends headers, making the subsequent `NextResponse.rewrite` attempt invalid, causing the `Headers already sent` error.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix\n\n1. **Remove Redundant Redirects/Rewrites:** The primary solution is to ensure that you have only *one* `NextResponse` call that modifies the response. Remove any extra `redirect`, `rewrite`, or `json` calls after the initial response modification.\n\n2. **Correct Middleware:**  Here's the corrected middleware function:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));  //Only one redirect\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'], // Match routes starting with /protected\n};\n```\n\nThis revised code only contains one redirect, preventing the `Headers already sent` error.  Choose `redirect` or `rewrite` based on whether you want to preserve the original URL or not in the browser's history.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `Headers already sent` error is fundamentally a consequence of violating HTTP protocol rules. Once your server starts sending the HTTP response headers, it cannot change them. The `NextResponse` object in Next.js middleware allows modifying headers and performing redirects; however, only one such operation is permitted per middleware execution.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Understanding HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
