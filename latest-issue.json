[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create a pulsating button effect using only CSS.  This technique utilizes CSS animations and keyframes to achieve a visually appealing and subtle animation without the need for JavaScript.  This is a great example of how CSS can be used to add dynamic visual effects to a website.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling creates a button that subtly expands and contracts in size, giving the appearance of a gentle pulse. This is achieved using a CSS animation that cycles through different scaling transformations. The animation is smooth and non-distracting, enhancing the user experience without being overly flashy.  We'll customize the button's appearance using basic CSS properties as well.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Pulsating Button</title>\n<style>\n.pulsating-button {\n  background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */\n  border: none;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 15px 32px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  margin: 4px 2px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  animation: pulsate 1s ease-in-out infinite; /* Add the animation */\n}\n\n@keyframes pulsate {\n  0% {\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    transform: scale(1.05);\n  }\n  100% {\n    transform: scale(1);\n  }\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>Click the Pulsating Button!</h1>\n\n<button class=\"pulsating-button\">Click Me</button>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **HTML Structure:**  A simple HTML button element with the class `pulsating-button` is created.\n\n2. **CSS Styling:** The `pulsating-button` class styles the button with a green background, white text, padding, and other basic button properties.\n\n3. **CSS Animation:** The `animation` property applies the `pulsate` animation to the button.  This animation has a duration of 1 second (`1s`), uses an `ease-in-out` timing function for a smooth transition, and is set to run infinitely (`infinite`).\n\n4. **`@keyframes pulsate`:** This section defines the animation itself.  It uses the `transform: scale()` property to change the size of the button.  At 0% and 100% of the animation, the scale is 1 (normal size).  At 50%, the scale is 1.05 (slightly larger), creating the pulsating effect.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Animations:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
