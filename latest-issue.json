[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically to reveal more content when clicked.  No JavaScript is required. This example uses plain CSS3; however, the concept could easily be adapted to a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe core technique uses CSS transitions and the `max-height` property.  The card starts with a small `max-height`, limiting its visible content. On click, the `max-height` is dynamically changed to allow the card to expand to its full content height.  The transition smooths the expansion animation.  We also style the card with some basic visual enhancements.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows max-height */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  cursor: pointer;\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n  padding:10px;\n}\n\n.card.expanded {\n  max-height: 500px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded')\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some sample text for the card content.  You can add as much text as you need here.  The card will expand to fit the content.</p>\n    <p>More text to demonstrate the expansion.</p>\n    <p>Even more text!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the card itself.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from overflowing before expansion. `transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;`  creates the smooth animation. `max-height: 100px;` sets the initial restricted height.\n* **`.card.expanded`:** This class is applied when the card is clicked. `max-height: 500px;` sets the height to allow the full content to be displayed.  You should adjust `500px` to a value larger than your expected maximum content height.\n* **`onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded')\"`:** This inline JavaScript (minimal and acceptable for this simple example) toggles the `expanded` class on the card when it is clicked.  For larger projects, consider separating JavaScript logic from HTML.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [CSS max-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-height)\n* [Learn CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) (general CSS learning resource)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
