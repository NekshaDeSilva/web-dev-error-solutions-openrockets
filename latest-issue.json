[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing animation without JavaScript.  We'll use plain CSS3 for this example, but the concepts can be adapted to other CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a compact state. When the user hovers over it, the card expands horizontally, revealing more content. The expansion is animated smoothly using a CSS transition.  We'll achieve this using the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `transform` property for scaling.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate it's interactive */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scaleX(1.2); /* Expand horizontally on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Hover Over Me!</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample text that will appear when the card expands.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card element.  `width`, `height`, `background-color`, and `border-radius` define its appearance.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to keep the expanding content within the card's boundaries.  The `transition` property applies a smooth animation to the `transform` property, making the expansion look seamless.  `cursor: pointer` changes the cursor to a hand to indicate interactivity.\n\n* **`.card:hover`:**  This pseudo-class targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `transform: scaleX(1.2)` scales the card horizontally by a factor of 1.2 (increasing its width by 20%).\n\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content inside the card.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
