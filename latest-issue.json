[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when manipulating headers within Next.js Middleware: unexpected behavior or errors when attempting to modify the `headers` object directly.  The problem often stems from misunderstanding the asynchronous nature of Middleware and how changes to the `headers` object propagate.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nYou might encounter unexpected behavior or errors when trying to directly modify the `headers` object within your middleware function.  For instance, setting a header might not take effect, or you might receive an error indicating the object is read-only or that a certain header cannot be modified.  This is often due to attempting to modify the headers *after* the response has already started being sent.\n\n**Example Scenario:**  Let's say you're trying to add a custom header for security purposes:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  // Incorrect approach - likely to cause issues\n  res.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'MyValue';\n  return NextResponse.next(); \n}\n```\n\nThis approach frequently fails because `res.headers` is not directly mutable in the way you might expect.  Next.js manages the header manipulation internally for efficiency and consistency.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe correct way to manipulate headers is to use the `NextResponse` object's `headers` method:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'MyValue'); // Correct approach\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `NextResponse` object provides a clean and consistent way to interact with the response, including headers.  Instead of trying to directly modify a potentially immutable `res.headers` object, you create a `NextResponse` instance (using `NextResponse.next()` to indicate continuation to the next handler) and then use its `.headers.set()` method to add or modify headers.  This ensures the headers are properly handled by Next.js's internal mechanisms and avoids potential conflicts or errors.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  (Check for the most updated version)\n\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* **Header Case Sensitivity:** Header names are case-insensitive.  `'X-Custom-Header'` is equivalent to `'x-custom-header'`.\n* **Header Conflicts:** If you try to set a header that is already set, the later call will override the earlier one.\n* **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure all header manipulations occur before the `NextResponse` is returned.  Any asynchronous operations within the middleware must be awaited before setting headers to avoid race conditions.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
