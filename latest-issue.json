[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers face when working with Next.js API routes: exceeding the default response size and timeout limits, leading to errors and incomplete data delivery.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen your API route processes a request that generates a very large response (e.g., a large JSON object or a stream of data), Next.js might encounter a timeout or hit a size limit before the entire response is sent to the client. This results in incomplete data or a 500 Internal Server Error. The error message might be vague and not directly pinpoint the size/timeout issue.\n\n**Code Example (Problem):**\n\nLet's say you have an API route that generates a very large JSON response:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/largeData.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const largeArray = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => ({ id: i, data: 'some large data' }));\n  res.status(200).json(largeArray);\n}\n```\n\nThis might cause a timeout or exceed the response size limit depending on your Next.js configuration and the server's resources.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Streaming the Response:**  Instead of sending the entire JSON array at once, stream the data using a `ReadableStream`:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/largeData.js\nimport { Readable } from 'stream';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const largeArray = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => ({ id: i, data: 'some large data' }));\n\n  const stream = new Readable({\n    objectMode: true,\n    read() {\n      for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { //Chunk the data\n        if (largeArray.length === 0) {\n          this.push(null);\n          return;\n        }\n        this.push(largeArray.shift());\n      }\n    },\n  });\n\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');\n  stream.pipe(res);\n}\n```\n\n2. **Increasing Timeouts (Less Recommended):**  While streaming is the preferred solution, you can increase the timeout limits in your Next.js configuration (e.g., using environment variables or a custom server).  This approach is less ideal because it might mask underlying performance problems.  The method depends on how you deploy your application (Vercel, custom server etc.). Refer to your deployment platform's documentation for more details.\n\n3. **Chunking the Response (Alternative Streaming Method):** Another approach involves sending data in smaller chunks:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/largeData.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n    const largeArray = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => ({ id: i, data: 'some large data' }));\n    const chunkSize = 1000;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < largeArray.length; i += chunkSize) {\n      const chunk = largeArray.slice(i, i + chunkSize);\n      res.write(JSON.stringify(chunk));\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1)); //Small pause to prevent blocking\n    }\n    res.end();\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember that for this approach you need to adjust the `Content-Type` header to something like `application/octet-stream`  as it's no longer a single JSON object. The client side will then need to reassemble the chunks.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nStreaming avoids loading the entire response into memory at once.  It sends data in smaller, manageable chunks, preventing memory issues and timeouts. This is crucial for handling large datasets effectively.  Chunking provides a similar benefit but requires more manual control.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Node.js Readable Streams Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#readable)\n* [Vercel Serverless Functions Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/limits) *(Replace with your deployment platform's documentation)*\n\n**Copyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
