[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `\"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')\"`. This error typically arises when accessing the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property within middleware before it's properly defined.  This often happens due to incorrect middleware placement or attempting to access properties before the request is fully processed.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error message `\"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')\"` signifies that the `req.nextUrl` object, specifically its `pathname` property, is undefined when your middleware attempts to access it.  This prevents your middleware from correctly interpreting the URL and executing its intended logic.\n\n\n## Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix\n\nLet's assume we have middleware that tries to redirect requests based on the pathname:\n\n**Problematic Code (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/old-page') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-page', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/old-page'],\n};\n```\n\nThis code will throw the error because `req.nextUrl` might not be fully populated when the middleware function first executes.\n\n**Corrected Code (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Create a clone to avoid modifying the original request\n\n  if (url.pathname === '/old-page') {\n    url.pathname = '/new-page'; // Modify the pathname of the cloned URL\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Use rewrite instead of redirect for better caching\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next(); // Ensure a response is always returned\n}\n\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/old-page'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1. **Import `NextResponse`:**  We explicitly import `NextResponse` to ensure proper access to the necessary functions for redirecting or rewriting responses.\n2. **Clone `req.nextUrl`:** We create a clone of `req.nextUrl` using the `.clone()` method. This is crucial. Modifying the original `req.nextUrl` can lead to unexpected behaviour.  We operate on the clone, leaving the original request untouched.\n3. **Use `url.pathname`:** We now access the pathname from the cloned `url` object, guaranteeing it's defined.\n4. **`NextResponse.rewrite`:** We've switched from `NextResponse.redirect` to `NextResponse.rewrite`. This is generally preferred for better caching behavior, especially when handling internal URL changes.\n5. **`NextResponse.next()`:**  This line is crucial.  It ensures that if the condition (`url.pathname === '/old-page'`) is false, the middleware still returns a response.  Failing to return a response can lead to unexpected errors.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n* [Understanding Request Objects in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/requests) (search for relevant sections on request objects within the larger documentation)\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue is the asynchronous nature of the request handling within Next.js Middleware.  The `req.nextUrl` object is populated as part of the request processing pipeline. If you try to access it too early, before the pipeline has completed populating it, you'll encounter the `undefined` error. Cloning `req.nextUrl` allows you to work with a copy that you're guaranteed to be able to modify without interfering with the overall request handling.  Always ensure your middleware functions return a `NextResponse` object, regardless of the conditions within your logic.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
