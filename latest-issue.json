[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`. This error typically arises when attempting to access the `pathname` property of the `req` object within middleware before it's properly defined.  This often happens when the middleware tries to access request details too early in the process, before Next.js has fully populated the request object.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` error indicates that the JavaScript engine is trying to read the `pathname` property from an undefined `req` object. This means the `req` object, which usually contains information about the incoming HTTP request, is not yet initialized when your middleware attempts to access it.\n\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's imagine you're building authentication middleware. A common approach is to check if a user is logged in based on the presence of an authentication token in a cookie or in the request headers. If the middleware attempts this check before the request is fully processed, it will throw the aforementioned error.\n\n\n**Problem Code (Incorrect):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname; // Error occurs here!\n\n  if (pathname === '/admin') {\n    // Check for authentication token\n    const token = req.cookies.authToken;\n    if (!token) {\n      res.redirect('/login');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Use `Request` Object:** The core issue lies in accessing `req.nextUrl.pathname` directly. Instead, we need to leverage the `Request` object to ensure the request is fully initialized. This object provides a more robust way to access request details within the middleware context.\n\n2. **Asynchronous Operations:**  Middleware functions should be asynchronous to handle potential delays in data fetching. This ensures the request object is properly populated before the pathname is accessed.\n\n3. **Await `nextUrl`:** `nextUrl` is a Promise, so it needs to be awaited to get its value.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Clone the URL to avoid modifying the original\n  const pathname = url.pathname;\n\n  if (pathname === '/admin') {\n    const token = req.cookies.get('authToken'); // Assuming you're using cookies\n\n    if (!token) {\n      url.pathname = '/login';  // Redirect to login page\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Use NextResponse for redirects\n    }\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* We now use `req.nextUrl.clone()` to create a copy of the URL object, preventing unintended modifications of the original request.\n* We await the resolution of `req.nextUrl` to ensure its properties are available.\n* We use `NextResponse.rewrite()` to perform redirects.  `res.redirect()` is not available in middleware.\n* We use `req.cookies.get('authToken')` for accessing the cookie, which is a more robust way than accessing `req.cookies` directly, especially when dealing with multiple cookies.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n* [Working with Cookies in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#working-with-cookies)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
