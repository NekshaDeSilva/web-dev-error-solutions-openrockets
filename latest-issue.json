[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis example creates a simple card that expands horizontally when the user hovers over it.  The expansion is smooth thanks to CSS transitions.  We'll use a basic structure with a container, an image, and some text. The key is manipulating the `width` and `transform` properties with transitions.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Important for hiding overflowing content during transition */\n  transition: width 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n  display: block; /* Remove extra space below image */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 300px; /* Expand on hover */\n  transform: translateX(-50px); /* Add a slight shift to make it visually appealing*/\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/200x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Card Title</h3>\n    <p>Some descriptive text about the card goes here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to prevent content from overflowing during the expansion. `transition` property smoothly animates changes in `width` and `transform` over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease\" timing function.\n* **`.card img`**:  This styles the image within the card to ensure it scales appropriately. `display: block` removes the default space below inline elements.\n* **`.card-content`**:  This styles the text content within the card.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This styles the card when the user's mouse hovers over it. `width` is increased to 300px for expansion.  `transform: translateX(-50px)` shifts the card slightly to the left to prevent it from abruptly appearing to the right.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
