[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js API routes: the `Error: Route is not found` error.  This typically occurs when Next.js cannot locate the requested API route.  This can stem from various issues, including incorrect file naming, path mismatches, or configuration problems.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Error: Route is not found` error in Next.js API routes manifests as a 404 error in the browser's developer console or in your application logs.  It indicates that the client's request to a specific API endpoint failed because Next.js couldn't find the corresponding API route handler file.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you're building an API route to fetch data from a database. You might create a file named `pages/api/data.js`, expecting it to handle requests to `/api/data`. However, if you misspell the filename (e.g., `pages/api/datas.js`) or place it in the wrong directory, you will encounter this error.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you're trying to create an API route at `/api/hello` that returns a JSON response.\n\n**Incorrect Code (Illustrative):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/hello.ts  (Incorrect filename: should be hello.js)\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from API Route!' });\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/hello.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from API Route!' });\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1. **File Extension:** The original example used `.ts` (TypeScript).  Next.js API routes generally work best with `.js` files unless you have specifically configured TypeScript support.  While TypeScript is possible, sticking to `.js` for simplicity often avoids unexpected issues.\n\n\n2. **File Path:** The `pages/api` directory is crucial.  All API routes must reside within this directory.  Any deviations will result in a 404.\n\n\n**Verification:**\n\nAfter making the correction, restart your Next.js development server.  Access the API route in your browser (or using a tool like Postman) via:  `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. You should now receive the JSON response: `{\"message\": \"Hello from API Route!\"}`.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)  (Official documentation for Next.js API routes)\n* **Troubleshooting Next.js:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/troubleshooting](https://nextjs.org/docs/troubleshooting) (General troubleshooting guide for Next.js)\n\n\n**Further Troubleshooting Tips:**\n\n* **Check your `next.config.js`:** Ensure you haven't made any configurations that might interfere with API routes.\n* **Inspect Network Tab:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see the exact request and response details.  This helps pinpoint the source of the problem.\n* **Use a REST client:** Tools like Postman provide more detailed error messages than a simple browser request.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
