[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: rate limits.  Discord implements rate limits to prevent abuse and maintain the stability of its platform.  Exceeding these limits results in errors, preventing your bot from functioning correctly.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen your bot sends too many requests to the Discord API within a short period, you'll typically encounter a `DiscordAPIError` with a message indicating a rate limit.  This error might look something like this (the specifics vary depending on the type of rate limit hit):\n\n```\nDiscordAPIError: 429: Too Many Requests\n```\n\nThis error halts your bot's operation until the rate limit window expires.  Ignoring this can lead to your bot being temporarily or permanently banned from the Discord API.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis example focuses on handling rate limits when sending messages.  The key is to use `setTimeout` to introduce delays between API calls.\n\n**Before (problematic code):**\n\n```javascript\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Discord.Client({ intents: [Discord.GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, Discord.GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', (message) => {\n  if (message.content === '!spam') {\n    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n      message.channel.send(`Message ${i}`); // This will hit rate limits!\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**After (with rate limit handling):**\n\n```javascript\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Discord.Client({ intents: [Discord.GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, Discord.GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {\n  if (message.content === '!spam') {\n    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n      try {\n        await message.channel.send(`Message ${i}`);\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Wait 500ms (0.5 seconds)\n      } catch (error) {\n        if (error.code === 50035) { // Handle this specific error - missing access\n            console.log(\"Missing permissions in this channel\")\n        } else if (error.httpStatus === 429) {\n          console.error('Rate limited!', error);\n          const retryAfter = error.retryAfter; // Get the retry time from the error\n          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter)); // Wait before retrying\n        } else {\n          console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1. **`async/await`:** The `async` keyword makes the function asynchronous, allowing us to use `await` to pause execution while waiting for the promise returned by `message.channel.send()`.\n\n2. **`setTimeout`:** This function introduces a delay of 500 milliseconds (adjust as needed) between each message.  This helps to stay within Discord's rate limits.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential errors, including rate limit errors.  The code specifically checks for a 429 status code and uses the `retryAfter` property (if available) from the error object to determine the appropriate delay before retrying.  Adding a check for error.code === 50035 handles another common error (missing access).\n\n4. **Dynamic Retry:**  The improved code now uses the `retryAfter` value provided in the error to wait the exact time specified by Discord before making another attempt. This is more efficient than a fixed delay.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Guide:** [https://discord.js.org/#/](https://discord.js.org/#/) (Check the documentation for the latest API information)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:**  (Unfortunately, there isn't a single, centralized, publicly available document specifying *all* Discord rate limits.  The limits are dynamic and enforced at the server level and may not be fully disclosed.)\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nRate limiting is crucial for preventing abuse of the Discord API. By implementing these strategies, you make your bot more robust and avoid disruptions caused by exceeding the allowed request frequency.  Remember to adjust the delay (`500ms` in the example) based on your bot's activity and the type of requests you're making.  Experimentation and monitoring are key to finding the optimal delay.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
