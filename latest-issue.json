[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: unpredictable behavior of `request.nextUrl.pathname`  especially when dealing with redirects and rewrites within the middleware. The problem often arises when the pathname doesn't accurately reflect the intended URL after a rewrite or redirect within the middleware itself. This can lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent middleware functions or the client-side application.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `request.nextUrl` object, specifically its `pathname` property, might not always be reliably updated after using `request.nextUrl.pathname = newPathname`  within a middleware function.  This can cause unexpected routing behavior downstream. You might find that subsequent middleware functions or even your client-side application see an incorrect `pathname`, leading to broken links, 404 errors, or other inconsistencies.  This is particularly problematic when combining rewrites and redirects within multiple middleware functions.\n\n**Step-by-step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's illustrate this with an example and its solution.  Suppose we want to redirect all requests to `/blog` to `/news` and then add a language prefix based on the `Accept-Language` header. Incorrectly handling `request.nextUrl.pathname` might lead to issues.\n\n\n**Incorrect approach:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/blog') {\n    req.nextUrl.pathname = '/news'; // This might not be reliably updated for subsequent middleware.\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);\n  }\n\n  if (req.headers.get('accept-language')?.startsWith('es')) {\n    req.nextUrl.pathname = `/es${req.nextUrl.pathname}`;  // This will likely fail if the prior rewrite didn't correctly update pathname.\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Correct approach:**\n\nThe key is to consistently use `NextResponse.rewrite` or `NextResponse.redirect` and let Next.js manage the URL updates internally.  Avoid directly manipulating `request.nextUrl.pathname` except in very specific circumstances.\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/blog') {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/news', req.url));\n  }\n\n  if (req.headers.get('accept-language')?.startsWith('es')) {\n    const newUrl = new URL(req.url);\n    newUrl.pathname = `/es${newUrl.pathname}`;\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(newUrl);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version utilizes `NextResponse.rewrite` with a correctly constructed `URL` object for each rewrite. Next.js's internal mechanisms handle updating the `request.nextUrl` object reliably.\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe problem lies in how the middleware updates the URL.  Directly modifying `req.nextUrl.pathname` doesn't guarantee that other parts of the middleware or the rendering process will immediately reflect this change.  By using `NextResponse.rewrite` or `NextResponse.redirect` with a new `URL` object, we allow Next.js to manage the URL update in a consistent and reliable manner. The `URL` object ensures the entire URL, including pathname, is correctly updated.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/server-actions-utils#nextresponse)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
