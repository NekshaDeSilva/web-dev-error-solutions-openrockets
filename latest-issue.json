[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: rate limiting errors.  These errors occur when your bot attempts to send messages, edit messages, or perform other actions too frequently, exceeding the limits set by Discord to prevent abuse and maintain server stability.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nDiscord.js will typically throw an error when a rate limit is encountered.  The exact error message may vary depending on the version of the library and the specific action causing the limit, but it usually indicates that a request has been rejected due to exceeding the rate limit. You might see something like: `DiscordAPIError: 429: Too Many Requests`  This often results in your bot ceasing to function correctly, failing to respond to commands or messages.\n\n\n## Fixing Rate Limits in Discord.js\n\nThe most effective way to handle rate limits is to use the built-in rate limit handling provided by Discord.js.  This involves using `await` and catching the `DiscordAPIError` to implement a delay before retrying.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code:**\n\nLet's say you have a function that sends a message:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\nasync function sendMessage(channel, message) {\n  try {\n    await channel.send(message);\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.code === 50007) {\n        console.log(\"Message too long. Please shorten the message.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    if (error.httpStatus === 429) {\n      const retryAfter = error.rateLimitRemaining ? error.rateLimitRemaining * 1000 : 1000; // Delay in milliseconds\n      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryAfter / 1000} seconds...`);\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter));\n      await sendMessage(channel, message); // Retry the message sending\n    } else {\n      console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', msg => {\n    if (msg.content === '!test') {\n      sendMessage(msg.channel, 'This is a test message!');\n    }\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`async function sendMessage(...)`:** The `async` keyword allows us to use `await` within the function.\n2. **`try...catch` block:** This handles potential errors during message sending.\n3. **`error.code === 50007`:** This specifically catches message too long errors.\n4. **`error.httpStatus === 429`:** This checks if the error code is 429 (Too Many Requests).\n5. **`retryAfter` calculation:** This determines the delay before retrying.  It uses the `rateLimitRemaining` property from the error object if available; otherwise it defaults to a 1-second delay.\n6. **`await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter))`:** This pauses execution for the specified `retryAfter` time.\n7. **`await sendMessage(channel, message)`:** This recursively calls the `sendMessage` function to retry sending the message after the delay.\n8. **Error Handling:** The `else` block logs any other errors encountered.  More robust error handling could be implemented here as needed.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Documentation:** [https://discord.js.org/](https://discord.js.org/) (Refer to the API documentation for more detailed information on error handling and rate limits)\n* **Discord API Documentation:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) (Understand Discord's rate limit policies)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
