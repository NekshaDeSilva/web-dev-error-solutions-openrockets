[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the \"headers already sent\" error.  This typically occurs when you attempt to send headers to the client after the response stream has already begun.  This can manifest in various ways, often related to improper use of `next/server`'s `NextResponse` object or accidental double-sending of headers.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe \"headers already sent\" error in Next.js Middleware is a runtime error that prevents your middleware from properly modifying the response.  It usually appears as a cryptic error message in your terminal or logs, indicating that HTTP headers have already been committed to the client before your middleware attempted to modify or add them.  This prevents your middleware from correctly manipulating cookies, setting redirects, or performing other header-based manipulations.\n\n**Scenario:** Let's say we're trying to implement authentication middleware that redirects unauthenticated users to a login page.\n\n**Problematic Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (Incorrect)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    console.log(\"Redirecting to Login\"); //This will be logged but the redirect won't happen.\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n    //Problem: If something here produces an output to the client before this, the error happens\n    //Example:  console.log(\"hello there\", {headers:req.headers}) would result in this error.\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Ensure Single `NextResponse` Return:** The primary cause is often multiple attempts to send a response.  Make absolutely sure that your middleware function only returns a single instance of `NextResponse`.  Avoid any stray console logs or other actions that might inadvertently send data before `NextResponse` takes control.\n\n2. **Proper Error Handling:**  Wrap your middleware logic in a `try...catch` block to catch potential errors that might prematurely send data before you call `NextResponse`.\n\n3. **Careful Cookie Handling:** If you're manipulating cookies, be extra cautious.  Some libraries or methods might inadvertently send data or headers before your `NextResponse`.\n\n4. **Review Other Middleware/API Routes:**  Ensure no other middleware or API routes are interfering with your headers.  If you have multiple middleware functions, review their order of execution and potential conflicts.\n\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (Corrected)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');\n\n  try {\n    if (!token) {\n      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n    }\n    //If you need to send extra headers,do this:\n    //return NextResponse.next({ headers: { 'Custom-Header': 'Some value' } });\n\n    return NextResponse.next(); // Allow the request to proceed\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error in middleware:\", error);\n    return NextResponse.json({ error: \"Internal Server Error\" }, { status: 500 });\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully. It also ensures that only one `NextResponse` is returned, preventing the \"headers already sent\" issue.  The `NextResponse.next()` allows the request to continue if authentication succeeds.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
