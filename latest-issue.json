[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content with a smooth transition.  No JavaScript is required.  This example leverages standard CSS properties and avoids frameworks like Tailwind for clarity and educational purposes.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card is designed with a basic structure: a container holding a header and a content area. The content area initially has a height of zero and is hidden.  On hover, the container's height is adjusted, revealing the content using a transition for a smooth animation.  We use `overflow: hidden` on the container to initially mask the content and ensure a clean reveal.  Box-shadow adds a subtle depth effect.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card-header {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 15px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content until expanded */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Match container transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  height: auto; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">Expanding Card</div>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is the content of the expanding card.  You can add as much text or other elements here as you like.  The card will smoothly expand to accommodate the content.</p>\n    <p>Notice the smooth transition effect achieved using CSS transitions.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the main container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial for masking the initially hidden content.  The `transition` property ensures a smooth animation.\n* **`.card-header`**: Styles the header section.\n* **`.card-content`**:  Crucially, `height: 0` hides the content initially, and `overflow: hidden` prevents content from overflowing before expansion. The `transition` matches the container's transition for synchronization.\n* **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This selector targets the `.card-content` element *only* when the `.card` element is hovered.  `height: auto` allows the content to expand naturally to fit its content.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Transitions):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks (Advanced CSS Techniques):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (Search for articles on transitions and animations)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
