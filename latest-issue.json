[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using `NextResponse.redirect()` within Next.js Middleware:  unintentional infinite redirect loops.  This happens when the redirect condition isn't properly managed, causing the middleware to repeatedly redirect the request, resulting in a browser error.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen using `NextResponse.redirect()` in middleware, if the condition triggering the redirect is always true (or perpetually becomes true due to a bug), the middleware will redirect the request again and again.  The browser will detect this as an infinite loop and will typically display an error message indicating a \"too many redirects\" or similar problem.  This can be especially frustrating to debug because the error isn't always clear from the middleware's logs.\n\n\n**Example Scenario and Code (Problem):**\n\nLet's say we want to redirect all requests to `/login` unless the user is authenticated.  The following middleware implementation contains a flaw that leads to an infinite redirect loop:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = false; // Simulating unauthenticated user. Replace with actual auth logic.\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\nIn this faulty code, `isAuthenticated` is always `false`. Therefore, every request triggers a redirect to `/login`.  Because `/login` (presumably) also runs this middleware, it results in an endless redirect chain.\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Correct Authentication Check:** The most important step is ensuring that your authentication check (`isAuthenticated`) is accurate and reliable. This usually involves accessing session data, cookies, or JWTs.  Replace the placeholder `isAuthenticated = false;` with your actual authentication mechanism.  For example, using a cookie:\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token'); // Get token from cookie\n\n  const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0; //Simple check, refine as needed.\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n2. **Avoid Redirecting from the Login Page:**  The crucial step is preventing the middleware from re-redirecting when the request originates from the login page itself. We'll add a check for that.\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');\n  const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0;\n\n  const currentPath = new URL(req.url).pathname;\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated && currentPath !== '/login') { //only redirect if not on /login\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n3. **Consider using `rewrite` instead of `redirect` (optional):**  If the goal is to simply handle the routing internally rather than visibly redirect the user, consider using `NextResponse.rewrite()` instead.  This will change the URL internally without updating the browser's URL bar.  This approach depends on the logic you are implementing.\n\n```javascript\n//Using rewrite instead of redirect.  Only use this if it suits your logic.\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n    const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token');\n    const isAuthenticated = token !== null && token.length > 0;\n    const currentPath = new URL(req.url).pathname;\n\n    if (!isAuthenticated && currentPath !== '/login') {\n        return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url));\n    }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key to avoiding infinite redirects is to break the cycle. By ensuring that the middleware only redirects when the user is *not* authenticated and the request is *not* already directed at the login page, the loop is prevented.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse.redirect() API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponseredirect)\n* [NextResponse.rewrite() API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponserewrite)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
