[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This effect involves a card that expands to reveal more content when clicked.  We'll utilize CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth and elegant animation.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will have a basic design, featuring a title and a short description initially visible.  Upon clicking, the card will expand vertically, revealing additional content that was initially hidden. The expansion will be accompanied by a subtle transition effect. We'll use a clean, minimalist aesthetic for clarity.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate that the card is clickable */\n  max-height: 150px; /* Initial height of the card */\n}\n\n.card.expanded {\n  max-height: 400px; /* Height when expanded */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-description {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-extra-content {\n  display: none; /* Initially hide extra content */\n}\n\n.card.expanded .card-extra-content {\n  display: block; /* Show extra content when expanded */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded')\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-description\">Click to expand and see more details.</p>\n    <p class=\"card-extra-content\">This is the extra content that appears when the card is expanded.  You can add as much content as you need here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`max-height` and `transition`:** These properties are key to the expansion effect. `max-height` initially limits the card's height, and `transition` smoothly animates the height change when `max-height` is modified.\n* **`.expanded` class:** This class is toggled using JavaScript's `classList.toggle()` method.  When added, it changes the `max-height` and displays the hidden content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is crucial to prevent content from spilling out during the transition.\n* **`display: none;` and `display: block;`:**  These control the visibility of the extra content.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Transitions):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Transforms):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (Transitions and Animations):** [https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
