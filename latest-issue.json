[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within or overlapping a CanvasJS chart:  **failure to initialize the VideoJS player correctly, often resulting in a blank video area or playback errors.** This typically stems from conflicts between the two libraries' DOM manipulation or timing issues during page load.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe VideoJS player either doesn't appear at all, displays a broken placeholder, or throws JavaScript errors in the console related to player initialization (`TypeError`, `undefined` errors referencing VideoJS elements, etc.)  This usually occurs when the VideoJS player is initialized *before* the CanvasJS chart is fully rendered or when the elements are not properly positioned within the HTML structure.\n\n**Code for Fixing the Problem (Step-by-Step):**\n\nThis solution uses a combination of ensuring proper element placement in HTML, using VideoJS's `ready` event and checking for element visibility before initialization.\n\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\nEnsure your HTML properly nests the elements.  Place the `<video>` tag *after* the `<div>` where your CanvasJS chart will be rendered.  This ensures the CanvasJS chart's DOM manipulation doesn't interfere with VideoJS's player creation:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\"></div>\n<video id=\"myVideo\" class=\"video-js vjs-big-play-centered\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\">\n  <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <source src=\"myvideo.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7/dist/video.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// JavaScript code (see step 2)\n</script>\n```\n\n\n**2. JavaScript Initialization:**\n\nUse the VideoJS `ready` event to ensure the player is initialized *after* the DOM is fully ready and the CanvasJS chart has been rendered. Also, add a check to ensure the VideoJS element is visible before initialization, to avoid issues with elements being hidden initially.\n\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = function() {\n    // CanvasJS Chart Initialization\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        // Your CanvasJS chart configuration here...\n    });\n    chart.render();\n\n    //Check if the video element is visible before initialization\n\n    let videoElement = document.getElementById(\"myVideo\");\n    let isVideoVisible = function() {\n      const rect = videoElement.getBoundingClientRect();\n      return (rect.top <= window.innerHeight &&\n              rect.bottom >= 0 &&\n              rect.left <= window.innerWidth &&\n              rect.right >= 0);\n    }\n\n    let initializeVideo = function() {\n        if (isVideoVisible()) {\n          videojs('myVideo').ready(function() {\n            var myPlayer = this;\n            // Add any VideoJS customization here...  e.g.,\n            myPlayer.on('loadeddata', function() {\n                console.log('Video loaded');\n            });\n          });\n        } else {\n          setTimeout(initializeVideo, 250); // Retry after 250ms\n        }\n    };\n    initializeVideo();\n\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution utilizes the `ready` event of VideoJS to guarantee that the player is fully initialized after the DOM is fully parsed and the chart rendering is complete. The visibility check handles scenarios where the video container might be hidden initially.  The `setTimeout` function ensures it retries a certain number of times before giving up if it still fails, adding resilience in case the chart or video player takes longer to load than anticipated. The `window.onload` function waits for the page to fully load before initiating chart and video rendering.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/docs/](https://canvasjs.com/docs/)\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
