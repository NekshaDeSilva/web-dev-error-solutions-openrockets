[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when developing serverless functions (API routes) within a Next.js application: `ReferenceError: process is not defined`.  This error arises because the `process` global object, commonly used in Node.js for environment variables and other system-related information, is *not* available within the serverless function execution environment provided by Vercel or other hosting platforms.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error occurs when your Next.js API route attempts to access the `process` object, which is typically available in Node.js environments but isn't directly accessible within the serverless environment. This often happens when using libraries or code snippets that rely on `process.env` to access environment variables or other `process` properties.\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/hello.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; // Error occurs here!\n\n  if (apiKey) {\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'API Key Found' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: 'API Key Not Found' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Identify the offending code:** Locate the lines of code that are causing the error.  In the example above, it's the line `const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;`.\n\n2. **Use `next/server`'s `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` (for pages):** If you're trying to access environment variables within a page component, `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` are the correct approach. These functions execute on the server and have access to the `process` object.  \n\n    ```javascript\n    // pages/my-page.js\n    export async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n      const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;\n      return { props: { apiKey } };\n    }\n    \n    export default function MyPage({ apiKey }) {\n        //Use apiKey here\n        return (\n          <div>\n              <h1>My Page</h1>\n              <p>API Key: {apiKey}</p>\n          </div>\n        )\n    }\n    ```\n\n\n3. **Use `next/config` for API routes:** If you're within an API route, you should avoid direct access to `process.env`. Instead, use the `next/config` module. This module provides a safe way to access environment variables in both client and server contexts.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // pages/api/hello.js\n    import { unstable_getServerSession } from \"next-auth/next\"; //if using next-auth\n    import config from 'next/config'\n    const { serverRuntimeConfig, publicRuntimeConfig } = config()\n\n\n    export default async function handler(req, res) {\n      const apiKey = serverRuntimeConfig.API_KEY; // Access the API key from serverRuntimeConfig\n\n      if (apiKey) {\n        res.status(200).json({ message: 'API Key Found' });\n      } else {\n        res.status(500).json({ message: 'API Key Not Found' });\n      }\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n4. **Define Environment Variables:** Make sure your API keys and other environment variables are correctly defined in your `.env.local` file (or the appropriate environment file for your deployment).  **Never commit `.env.*` files to your version control system.**\n\n    ```\n    # .env.local\n    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `process` object is a Node.js global, meaning it's automatically available in Node.js environments. However, Next.js API routes run within a serverless environment, which doesn't automatically provide the `process` object in the same way.  Using `next/config` ensures that environment variables are properly handled, regardless of the context (server-side or client-side rendering).  This is crucial for security and maintainability of your application.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)\n* [Next.js config](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/runtime-configuration)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
