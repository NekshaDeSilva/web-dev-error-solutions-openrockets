[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js API routes: `ReferenceError: process is not defined`. This error arises because API routes run in a Node.js environment, but certain libraries or code snippets assume a browser environment where the global `process` object is not available.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error means your API route code is attempting to access the `process` object, which is a global object in Node.js but not in a browser context. This typically occurs when you're using libraries or code that depend on Node.js-specific functionalities within your API route.  Next.js API routes run server-side in a Node.js environment, but some libraries might inadvertently try to access browser-specific APIs, leading to this conflict.\n\n\n**Example Scenario:**  Using a library that relies on `process.env` to access environment variables within the API route, but the library is not properly handled for the server-side environment.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you're using a library called `my-node-library` which relies on `process.env`.  The incorrect code might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/my-route.js\nimport myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; //Error occurs here in browser environment\n  const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey);\n  res.status(200).json(data);\n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nThe solution is to conditionally handle the access to `process.env` depending on the environment.  We can use the `process.browser` variable check (added in Next.js 13) to determine if we're in a browser environment:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/my-route.js\nimport myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  let apiKey;\n  if (typeof window === 'undefined') { //Check for server-side\n    apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;\n  } else {\n    // Handle the case where you are in a browser environment (if needed - unlikely in API routes)\n    //This is a fallback - API routes should not run in browser\n    console.error('API routes should not run in browser environment.');\n    apiKey = null; // Or fetch the key from a browser storage mechanism\n  }\n\n  if (apiKey){\n    const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey);\n    res.status(200).json(data);\n  } else {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'API Key not found' });\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, if the library allows for it, configure the library to not use `process.env` directly:\n\n```javascript\n//pages/api/my-route.js\nimport myNodeLibrary from 'my-node-library';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || 'fallbackApiKey'; //Provide a fallback\n\n  const data = await myNodeLibrary.fetchData(apiKey); //Assumes myNodeLibrary supports this configuration\n  res.status(200).json(data);\n}\n```\n\nThis revised code explicitly checks if the `process` object exists before accessing it, preventing the error.  The use of `typeof window === 'undefined'` is crucial here since `process` will not exist in the browser environment, and `window` will not exist in the server environment.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `process` object is a Node.js global that provides information about the current process.  Next.js API routes run on the server, so this object is available. However, if a library or code snippet tries to use it in a client-side context (e.g., within a regular Next.js component), it will be undefined, leading to the error.  The provided solution ensures the code only attempts to access `process.env` when it's guaranteed to exist.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Node.js `process` Object Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html)\n* [Next.js Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
