[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is the failure of charts to render correctly or at all. This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should be, or as a partially rendered or distorted chart.  This is primarily due to IE11's limited support for certain HTML5 canvas features and rendering engines used by CanvasJS.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis fix focuses on ensuring compatibility with IE11 by using a polyfill (a piece of code that provides functionality missing in older browsers) for the `requestAnimationFrame` API, which CanvasJS relies on for smooth animations and rendering.  While CanvasJS generally works better with modern browsers, this specific issue can be resolved with this polyfill.\n\n**1. Include the `requestAnimationFrame` Polyfill:**\n\nYou can include a polyfill directly in your HTML file or via a CDN. Here's an example using a CDN:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CanvasJS Chart in IE11</title>\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raf/3.3.0/raf.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Polyfill -->\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script> </head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        // Your chart configuration here... (see example below)\n        title:{\n            text: \"IE11 Compatible Chart\"\n        },\n        data: [\n        {\n            type: \"column\",\n            dataPoints: [\n                { label: \"Apple\", y: 10 },\n                { label: \"Orange\", y: 15 },\n                { label: \"Banana\", y: 25 }\n            ]\n        }\n        ]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**2.  Your CanvasJS Chart Configuration:**\n\nReplace the `// Your chart configuration here...` comment with your actual CanvasJS chart configuration.  The example above provides a simple column chart.  Refer to the CanvasJS documentation for more advanced configurations.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `requestAnimationFrame` API is crucial for efficient animation and rendering in modern browsers. IE11's implementation might be incomplete or buggy, leading to rendering problems with CanvasJS. The polyfill essentially provides a fallback implementation of `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring the API functions correctly even in older browsers like IE11. By including this polyfill, we bridge the compatibility gap and allow CanvasJS to function as expected.\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/docs/](https://canvasjs.com/docs/)  (Refer to their documentation for chart configuration and other details)\n* **`requestAnimationFrame` Polyfill (raf.js):** [https://github.com/cwilso/requestAnimationFrame](https://github.com/cwilso/requestAnimationFrame) (Source for the polyfill used)\n* **MDN Web Docs - `requestAnimationFrame()`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) (Understanding `requestAnimationFrame`)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
