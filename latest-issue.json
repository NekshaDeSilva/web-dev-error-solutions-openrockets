[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The effect involves a card that smoothly expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content. We'll use CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a clean and engaging user experience.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling utilizes a single `<div>` element with nested content.  The primary effect is achieved through CSS transitions on `max-height` and `transform` properties.  On hover, the card smoothly increases in height to reveal the initially hidden content, accompanied by a slight scaling effect for added visual appeal.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond max-height */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initially hides the content */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Expands on hover */\n  transform: scale(1.02); /* Subtle scaling effect */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card Example</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content that is initially hidden.  The card expands on hover to reveal this additional information.  You can customize the height and content as needed.</p>\n    <p>Add more content here to make the expansion effect more noticeable.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card element.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from overflowing the initial `max-height`.  The `transition` property defines the smooth animation for `max-height` and `transform`.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `max-height` is increased to reveal the hidden content.  `transform: scale(1.02);` adds a subtle scaling effect, making the expansion more visually appealing.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`**: These classes style the inner content of the card for better readability and structure.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - MDN documentation on CSS transitions.\n* [CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - MDN documentation on CSS transforms.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
