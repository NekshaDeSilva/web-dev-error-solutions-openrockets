[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect on hover.  No JavaScript is required.  The effect involves a card that smoothly expands to reveal more content when the mouse hovers over it, and collapses back when the mouse leaves.  We'll use pure CSS3 to achieve this.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a simple structure of a container div holding an image and some text content.  The core magic lies in CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class. We use transitions on `transform` and `box-shadow` properties to create a smooth expanding and shadow effect.  Padding and margin are adjusted on hover to create the expanding animation.  The image will slightly scale down on hover to give more emphasis to the text expansion.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content overflowing the card */\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth image transition */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth opacity and transform transitions */\n  transform: translateY(20px); /* Initial position before expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand the card slightly */\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow */\n}\n\n.card:hover img {\n  transform: scale(0.9); /* Scale down image slightly */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translateY(0); /* Move content to its final position */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample text for the expanding card. You can add more content here as needed.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:**  This is crucial for the smooth animation. We apply it to `transform` (for scaling) and `box-shadow` (for the shadow effect).  The `0.3s ease` value sets the duration and easing function for the transition.\n* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** This styles the element when the mouse cursor is over it.  We use it to change the `transform`, `box-shadow`, and opacity of elements.\n* **`transform: scale()`:** This scales the card and the image.  Scaling down the image while expanding the card gives a nice visual effect.\n* **`transform: translateY()`:** This moves the card content vertically, creating the expanding animation.\n* **`opacity`:** Used to control the visibility of the card content.\n* **`object-fit: cover;`:** Ensures the image covers the entire card area, maintaining aspect ratio.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (Search for \"hover effects\" or \"card animations\")\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
