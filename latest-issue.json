[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This is a common challenge showcasing CSS transitions and transforms to improve user experience and add visual appeal to web interfaces.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis design implements a card that expands vertically when hovered over.  The expansion is smooth thanks to CSS transitions.  The card uses a subtle shadow to provide depth and visual separation. The text within the card remains static while the card itself expands to reveal more content that would normally be hidden.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some example text that will be hidden initially and revealed on hover.</p>\n    <p>More text to demonstrate the expansion effect.</p>\n    <p>Even more text to make sure the expansion is noticeable.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the card itself. `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent the content from overflowing before the expansion.  The `transition` property defines the smooth animation of the `max-height` property.  `max-height` initially limits the card's height.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles when the mouse hovers over the card. The `max-height` is increased to reveal the full content.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and organization.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **Understanding Selectors:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
