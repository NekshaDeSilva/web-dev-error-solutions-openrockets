[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: **infinite redirect loops**.  This occurs when your middleware repeatedly redirects the user, creating a never-ending cycle.  This often happens due to improperly structured conditional logic or a lack of proper termination conditions.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe browser continuously redirects, leading to a \"too many redirects\" error in the browser console.  The user is unable to access the intended page.  This manifests as a blank page or a continuous spinning loading indicator.  The server logs might show repeated redirect attempts.\n\n## Code Example: Problem & Solution\n\n**Problematic Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  // Incorrect Logic - Always redirects\n  url.pathname = '/login';\n  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\nThis middleware *always* redirects to `/login`, regardless of the user's authentication status. This creates an infinite loop if `/login` also uses this middleware, or if the login process itself redirects in a way that again triggers the middleware.\n\n\n**Step-by-step Fix:**\n\n1. **Introduce Conditional Logic:** The middleware should only redirect if a specific condition isn't met (e.g., user is not logged in).\n\n2. **Check for Authentication:** We'll use a simplified example; replace this with your actual authentication method.\n\n3. **Avoid unnecessary redirects:**  Only redirect if a condition is true, otherwise return a normal response.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  const isLoggedIn = req.cookies.get('isLoggedIn'); // Replace with your auth check\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) {\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url); // Use redirect for better UX\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next(); // Allows the request to continue normally\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\nThis improved middleware only redirects to `/login` if the `isLoggedIn` cookie is not found.  If the user is logged in, `NextResponse.next()` allows the request to proceed to its intended destination, preventing the infinite redirect.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe original code created an infinite redirect loop because it unconditionally redirected to `/login`. The corrected code introduces a conditional check (`isLoggedIn`) and uses `NextResponse.redirect()` to redirect only when necessary. `NextResponse.next()` is crucial for allowing requests to continue naturally when the redirect condition is false.  Using `NextResponse.rewrite()` for redirects is generally discouraged because it can lead to caching issues; `NextResponse.redirect()` is preferred for user-facing redirects.\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n* [Handling Authentication in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication) (Find relevant sections on your authentication method)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
