[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a visualization created using CanvasJS.  The issue arises when the VideoJS player fails to initialize correctly, often manifesting as a blank space where the player should be, or error messages in the browser's console. This is frequently caused by conflicts between the libraries' JavaScript loading order or improper DOM element referencing.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe primary symptom is the absence of the VideoJS player within the intended CanvasJS chart container.  The browser's developer console may reveal errors related to undefined functions or elements, particularly those referencing the VideoJS player's initialization or associated elements (e.g., `videojs()` is not a function). This often occurs when the VideoJS library isn't fully loaded or hasn't been properly attached to its designated container before CanvasJS attempts to render its chart.\n\n\n**Fixing Step by Step (Code):**\n\nLet's assume you have a CanvasJS chart that includes a div element intended to hold the VideoJS player. We'll use this example to illustrate the solution.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CanvasJS and VideoJS Integration</title>\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Include CanvasJS -->\n<script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Include VideoJS -->\n<link href=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"> </div>\n<div id=\"myVideo\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\"></div>\n\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n\n  //Ensure VideoJS loads completely before attempting to use it\n  videojs('myVideo', {\n    sources: [{ src: 'your-video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }], // Replace with your video source\n    autoplay: false\n  }).ready(function(){\n      //Now that VideoJS is ready, initialize the CanvasJS chart\n      var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        //CanvasJS chart configuration here...\n        data: [\n            {\n                type: \"line\",\n                dataPoints: [\n                    { x: 10, y: 71 },\n                    { x: 20, y: 55 },\n                    { x: 30, y: 50 },\n                    { x: 40, y: 65 }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n      });\n      chart.render();\n  });\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key improvement is the use of `videojs().ready()`.  This ensures that the VideoJS player is fully initialized *before* the CanvasJS chart is rendered.  Previously, if the CanvasJS chart initialization ran before the VideoJS player was ready, errors would occur. By using `.ready()`, we defer the CanvasJS chart rendering until the VideoJS player is fully functional.  Make sure to replace `\"your-video.mp4\"` with the actual path to your video file. Also, ensure that your VideoJS and CanvasJS scripts are included in the correct order (as shown in the example).\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Refer to their documentation for detailed information on chart creation and configuration.)\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/) (Consult this for comprehensive information on VideoJS player setup and customization.)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
