[{"body":"\nThis document describes a common error encountered when using Next.js's `next/image` component outside the recommended context and provides a step-by-step solution.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error \"Invariant Violation: You are using a next/image component outside a `next/app` context\" occurs when you attempt to render a `<Image />` component within a page component that doesn't extend `App` or is not rendered within the context of a component that does.  This is because `next/image` requires specific optimization features provided by the `App` component's layout mechanism.  It is optimized for server-side rendering and image optimization, and these optimizations aren't available outside of the application's main structure.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you have a simple `Image` component you're trying to use in a page:\n\n**Incorrect Code (will throw the error):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/my-page.js\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image src=\"/images/my-image.jpg\" width={300} height={200} alt=\"My Image\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Code (using `App` component):**\n\n1. **Create or Modify `app/page.js` (or `app/layout.js`):**  If you are using the App Router (recommended for Next.js 13 and later), you'll need to wrap your existing page component within a layout.\n\n```javascript\n// app/page.js (or app/layout.js)\n\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport MyPage from './my-page'; // Import your original page component\n\nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        {children}\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n\nexport function MyPage(){\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image src=\"/images/my-image.jpg\" width={300} height={200} alt=\"My Image\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n\n2. **Migrate the component (if using pages router):**  If you're still using the Pages Router (Next.js 12 and earlier), migrating to the App Router is highly recommended for long-term compatibility and to take advantage of its performance and features.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `next/image` component leverages Next.js's built-in image optimization features, including automatic resizing, format optimization, and lazy loading.  These features require the component to be rendered within the context of the `App` component or its layout, which ensures proper integration with Next.js's rendering pipeline.  Using it outside this context prevents these optimizations and triggers the error.  By using the `app` directory and the `Layout` component or wrapping your existing page component within the App, you provide the necessary environment for `next/image` to function correctly.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)\n* [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application)\n* [Migrating from Pages Router to App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/migrating-from-pages-router)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
