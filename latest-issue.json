[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  The effect showcases a simple card that expands to reveal more content when hovered over. We'll use standard CSS3 properties for this example.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a combination of transitions, transforms, and pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) to achieve the expanding effect. The `::before` pseudo-element creates an overlay that slightly darkens the background on hover, while the main card content scales up, creating the expansion effect. The transition property smoothly animates the changes on hover.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  position: relative; /* Necessary for absolute positioning of pseudo-elements */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for transform property */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand the card on hover */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate that the card is interactive */\n}\n\n.card::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Semi-transparent black overlay */\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for opacity */\n}\n\n.card:hover::before {\n  opacity: 1; /* Show the overlay on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.card-content h3 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <div class=\"card-content\">\n      <h3>Expanding Card</h3>\n      <p>This is some sample text inside the expanding card.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This property is crucial for the smooth animation.  It specifies that the `transform` property should transition over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This scales the card up by 10% on hover, creating the expansion effect.\n* **Pseudo-elements (`::before`):** The `::before` pseudo-element creates a dark overlay that appears on hover, enhancing the visual effect.  Its opacity is transitioned smoothly.\n* **`position: relative` and `position: absolute`:**  `position: relative` on the card is necessary so that the absolutely positioned `::before` element is positioned relative to it.\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** This prevents the content from overflowing the card boundaries during the expansion.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (A great resource for learning CSS techniques)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
