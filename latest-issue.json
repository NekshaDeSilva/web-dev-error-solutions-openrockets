[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common error when working with Next.js Middleware and API Routes involves attempting to import modules from `next/server` within your API routes.  These modules, designed for middleware and edge functions, are not available in the serverless environment of API routes.  Attempting to do so will result in a runtime error, typically a `ReferenceError` indicating that a specific `next/server` module is not defined.  This is because API routes operate in a different Node.js environment than middleware.\n\n## Code Example: The Problem\n\nLet's say we have an API route that attempts to use the `NextResponse` object from `next/server`:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/hello.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'; // Incorrect import\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const response = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello' }); // Error here!\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will fail because `NextResponse` is not available in the API route context.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix\n\nTo resolve this, we need to use the standard Node.js `http` or `https` modules to craft our API responses:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/hello.js (Corrected)\nimport http from 'node:http'; // Correct import\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = { message: 'Hello from API Route!' };\n  res.status(200).json(data); // Correct response\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version utilizes the built-in `res` object provided by Next.js' API route handler, avoiding the `next/server` dependency entirely.  The `res.status(200).json(data)` approach is the standard way to return JSON responses from API routes.\n\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue stems from the distinct execution environments of Next.js Middleware and API Routes.  Middleware runs on the edge, leveraging the capabilities of `next/server` for performance-critical tasks like rewriting URLs or modifying headers before the request reaches the application.  API Routes, however, are serverless functions executed by a different runtime. They use a standard Node.js environment, and  `next/server`'s edge-specific modules are not available there.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Node.js `http` Module Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy understanding the difference between Next.js Middleware and API Routes' execution environments, we can avoid the common error of incorrectly importing `next/server` modules into API routes.  Using the standard Node.js `http` or `https` modules provides a reliable and consistent way to build robust API routes within your Next.js application.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
