[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands smoothly when hovered, revealing hidden content with a subtle animation.  We'll use only CSS, requiring no JavaScript. This example uses plain CSS, but could be easily adapted to a framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card utilizes transitions for smooth animation on hover.  The main container has a fixed height, initially showing only the title and a small portion of the content. On hover, the height expands, revealing the full content.  A subtle box-shadow is added for visual depth, and the content inside smoothly transitions with the card expansion.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  height: 150px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 1em;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for opacity change */\n  opacity: 1; /* Initially visible */\n}\n\n\n.card:hover .card-text {\n    opacity: 1; /* Fully visible on hover */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is the content of the expanding card.  It starts hidden and expands smoothly on hover.  You can add as much text as you like.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial. It tells the card to smoothly transition its `height` property over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function.  This creates the smooth expansion effect.\n* **`height: 150px;` and `height: 300px;`**: These set the initial and hover heights of the card, respectively.  Adjust these values to change the expansion size.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the content from overflowing the card before the expansion.\n* **`box-shadow`**: This adds a subtle shadow for visual enhancement.\n* The `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;` on `.card-text` provides a smooth fade-in effect for the content on hover.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks - Learn CSS:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (Search for tutorials on transitions and animations)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
