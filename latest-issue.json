[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using Next.js Middleware: incorrectly placing the `headers` manipulation code, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.  Middleware is powerful for modifying responses and redirects, but understanding its execution flow is crucial for correct implementation.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe most frequent problem is attempting to modify headers *after* the response has been fully generated and sent.  Next.js Middleware functions execute early in the request lifecycle. If you try to set headers *after* the response body has been written, your changes will be ignored. This often manifests as unexpected caching behavior, missing headers, or other subtle response inconsistencies.\n\n**Scenario:**  Imagine you want to add a `Cache-Control` header to all your pages to enable aggressive caching.  Placing the `setHeader` call too late in your middleware function will fail silently.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's illustrate the problem and solution with a simplified example.  We'll add a `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` header to all pages.\n\n**Incorrect Implementation (Problem):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  // INCORRECT PLACEMENT:  This happens AFTER the response is sent!\n  res.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000');\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\nThis code is incorrect because `res.headers.set` is called *after* `NextResponse.next()` which implicitly signals the response generation.  Next.js has already started sending the response by this point.\n\n**Correct Implementation (Solution):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  // CORRECT PLACEMENT: Setting headers BEFORE sending response\n  res.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000');\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\nThe only change is the order:  we set the headers *before* returning the response. This ensures Next.js includes the header in the response.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nNext.js Middleware functions operate in a specific order. The `NextResponse` object represents the response being sent to the client. Modifying its headers *before* calling `.next()` ensures the modifications are included in the final response.  Otherwise, these changes are ignored.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware) (Refer to the sections on `NextResponse` and response modification.)\n* **Next.js Headers Documentation:**  (While not explicitly dedicated to Middleware, understanding headers is essential)  [Search for \"Headers\" in Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)\n\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* Always test your middleware thoroughly.  Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual headers being sent to ensure your changes are working as expected.\n* Be mindful of the order of operations within your middleware function.  Headers should be set before any other significant response modifications.\n*  For complex scenarios involving redirects, ensure headers are set before calling `NextResponse.redirect()`.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
