[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when using VideoJS on iOS Safari is the failure of video playback to initiate or the video freezing intermittently.  This often manifests as a black screen, a spinning loading indicator that never stops, or abrupt pauses during playback.  The root cause often lies in the browser's handling of media codecs, particularly the lack of support for certain formats or the inability to correctly handle adaptive bitrate streaming.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis fix focuses on ensuring Video.js uses a codec that iOS Safari supports and handles potential issues with adaptive bitrate streaming.  We'll assume you're using an HTML5 video element and the Video.js player.\n\n**1.  Specify supported codecs:**\n\n```html\n<video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js vjs-big-play-centered\" controls preload=\"auto\" poster=\"poster.jpg\" data-setup=\"{}\">\n  <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'>\n  <source src=\"myvideo.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp8, vorbis\"'>\n  <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">\n    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that\n    <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a>\n  </p>\n</video>\n\n<script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  videojs('my-video');\n</script>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  We explicitly declare the codecs used in our MP4 and WebM sources.  `avc1.42E01E` (H.264) and `mp4a.40.2` (AAC) are generally well-supported on iOS. `vp8` and `vorbis` are included as fallback options, although H.264 is preferable for wider compatibility.  Ensure your video files are actually encoded using these codecs.  You can check this with media analysis tools.\n\n**2. Using a more robust adaptive streaming solution (if applicable):**\n\nIf you're using an adaptive bitrate streaming solution (like HLS or DASH), make sure you're using a well-tested and supported library that handles iOS-specific nuances.  The default VideoJS HLS plugin might need adjustments or replacement for optimal performance on iOS. Consider alternatives like `videojs-contrib-hls` or investigating the use of a dedicated adaptive streaming player library if problems persist.\n\n```javascript\n// Example using videojs-contrib-hls (requires installation)\n// Make sure to include the videojs-contrib-hls library in your project\n\nvideojs('my-video').ready(function(){\n  this.src({ src: 'hls-stream.m3u8', type: 'application/x-mpegURL' });\n});\n```\n\n**3.  Consider using a different video format:**\n\nAs a last resort, if the problems persist, consider encoding your video in a different format known to have strong iOS compatibility. While H.264 is generally preferred,  investigate if using a different encoding profile improves playback.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Video.js Documentation:** [https://docs.videojs.com/](https://docs.videojs.com/)\n* **HTML5 Video Support:** [https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/](https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/)\n* **Video.js Contrib-HLS:** (Look for the most up-to-date package information on npm or your preferred package manager)  - Note:  Always check for the latest version and installation instructions.\n* **Codec Information:**  Search for \"supported codecs iOS Safari\" for up-to-date information on supported formats.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue usually stems from incompatibility between the video codec used in your video file and the codecs supported by iOS Safari. By explicitly specifying the codecs and using a proven adaptive streaming solution, you increase the likelihood of successful playback.  Remember that browser and iOS version updates may introduce or resolve codec compatibility issues, so always stay updated on the latest information.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
