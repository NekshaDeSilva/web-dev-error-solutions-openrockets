[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  This effect utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly expand a card when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  We'll use plain CSS for maximum browser compatibility.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts in a compact state, displaying only a title and a small thumbnail image. Upon hovering over the card, it expands horizontally, revealing a larger image and additional text content. The expansion is animated smoothly using CSS transitions.  The reveal is subtly staged: the image expands first, followed by the text.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  perspective: 1000px; /* for 3D transition smoothness */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* overall transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* expands the card */\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* adds a subtle shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-image {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-size: cover;\n  background-position: center;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out 0.1s; /* image expands slightly later */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out 0.2s; /* text fades in later */\n  opacity: 0; /* initially hidden */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* text becomes visible on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-image\" style=\"background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/200x100');\"></div>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is some example text for the card.  You can put anything here!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`perspective`:**  This property is crucial for creating a smooth 3D scaling effect, preventing distortion during the expansion.\n* **`transition`:** This property defines the animation for the transformations. The `ease-in-out` timing function creates a smooth acceleration and deceleration.  The delayed transition on the image and text creates the subtle reveal effect.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This enlarges the card on hover.\n* **`box-shadow`:** Adds a visual cue of interaction.\n* **`opacity`:** Controls the visibility of the text content.\n*  The `background-image` in the `card-image` div uses a placeholder image URL. Replace this with your own image.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* [Understanding CSS Transitions and Transforms](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/) (A good tutorial)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
