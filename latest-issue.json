[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card with a subtle reveal effect.  The effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms, without any JavaScript.  We'll use standard CSS3 properties, making it compatible with most modern browsers.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis design creates a card that initially shows only a small portion of its content. Upon hovering, the card expands vertically, revealing the full content with a smooth transition.  A subtle shadow enhances the 3D effect.  The colour scheme is simple and can be easily customized.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initially */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>This is the title</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample text that will be revealed upon hovering over the card.  You can add more content here as needed.  The card expands smoothly to accommodate it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the card itself.  `width` and `height` set the initial dimensions. `background-color`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` provide visual appeal.  Crucially, `overflow: hidden` ensures the content exceeding the initial height is initially hidden.  `transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out` enables a smooth transition when the height changes.\n\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `height: 300px` increases the height, triggering the transition defined in `.card`.\n\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content within the card.  `padding` adds some spacing.\n\nThe interaction is entirely driven by the `:hover` pseudo-class and the `transition` property. No JavaScript is required.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
