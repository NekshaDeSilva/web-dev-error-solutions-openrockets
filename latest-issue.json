[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart visualization: the VideoJS player failing to initialize correctly, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be.  This usually happens when the VideoJS player's initialization code attempts to interact with the DOM element before the CanvasJS chart has fully rendered the element it's intended for.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error manifests as a blank area where your VideoJS player should be displayed.  The browser's developer console might not show any specific errors, making debugging more challenging.  The underlying cause is a race condition: VideoJS tries to initialize before the CanvasJS chart has created the div element the player is targeted at.\n\n**Code (Step-by-Step Fix):**\n\nThis solution uses a combination of CanvasJS's `afterSetOptions` event and a promise to ensure proper sequencing.  We'll assume your VideoJS setup is already in place (including including the VideoJS library).\n\n```javascript\n// CanvasJS chart setup\nvar chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    // ... your chart options ...\n    afterSetOptions: function() {\n        // Check if the element exists before initializing VideoJS\n        const videoContainer = document.getElementById(\"video-container\");\n        if (videoContainer) {\n            return new Promise((resolve) => {\n                //Check if videoContainer is ready \n                const checkInterval = setInterval(() => {\n                    if(videoContainer.offsetWidth > 0){\n                        clearInterval(checkInterval);\n                        // Initialize VideoJS player. This is where your current VideoJS initialization code goes.\n                        var player = videojs('video-container', {\n                          // Your VideoJS options here, like sources, controls etc.\n                          sources: [{ src: 'your_video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],\n                        });\n                        resolve();\n                    }\n                }, 100); //Check every 100ms. Adjust as needed.\n            });\n        }else {\n            console.error(\"Video Container element not found.\")\n        }\n    }\n});\nchart.render();\n```\n\n**HTML Structure:**\n\nMake sure your HTML includes a `<div>` element with the ID \"chartContainer\" for your CanvasJS chart and a nested `<div>` with the ID \"video-container\" where your VideoJS player will be embedded.  This structure allows the CanvasJS chart to render the `video-container` before VideoJS attempts to use it.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\">\n    <div id=\"video-container\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`afterSetOptions`:** This CanvasJS event fires after the chart's options are set and the chart begins rendering. This ensures the chart's DOM elements are created before proceeding.\n\n2. **Promise and `setInterval`:** The promise and `setInterval` function work together to asynchronously wait until the `video-container` element is actually rendered and has a width (meaning it's visible and ready). The `setInterval` keeps checking every 100ms until the element has a width greater than 0.  If the element is not found then an error is reported to the console. Adjust the interval time as needed based on your chart rendering speed.\n\n3. **Conditional Initialization:**  The code only initializes the VideoJS player if the `video-container` element exists. This adds an extra layer of safety.\n\n4. **VideoJS Initialization:** Replace `'your_video.mp4'` and other placeholder values with your actual video source and VideoJS options.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [CanvasJS Documentation](https://canvasjs.com/docs/): Official CanvasJS documentation.
