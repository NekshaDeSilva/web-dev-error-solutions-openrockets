[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: NextResponse must be called only inside a middleware`. This error arises when you attempt to use `NextResponse` outside the context of a middleware function. `NextResponse` is specifically designed for manipulating requests and responses within the middleware lifecycle.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error message `Error: NextResponse must be called only inside a middleware` indicates that you're trying to use the `NextResponse` object from the `next/server` package in a place where it's not allowed. This usually happens when you inadvertently call it within a regular page component, API route, or other non-middleware function.  Next.js Middleware has a specific execution context which allows `NextResponse` to modify the request/response cycle.  Using it elsewhere breaks this context.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's say you have the following incorrect code (example):\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/my-page.js (INCORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url)); //INCORRECT!\n  return <p>Hello, World!</p>;\n}\n```\n\nThis will throw the error.  The correct approach involves moving the redirect logic into a middleware file.\n\n**Correct Implementation:**\n\n1. **Create a Middleware file:** Create a file named `middleware.js` (or similar) inside the `pages` directory (or a subdirectory within `pages`).\n\n2. **Implement the Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(request) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/my-page') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.nextUrl));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/my-page'], // Specify the paths this middleware should apply to\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* We import `NextResponse` correctly within the middleware function.\n* The `middleware` function now receives the `request` object as an argument, allowing us to access the URL and other request details.\n* We use `request.nextUrl.pathname` to check the requested path.  This is safer than `request.url` which can include query parameters, etc.\n* `NextResponse.redirect` is used to create a redirect response.  We construct the `URL` object appropriately.\n* The `config.matcher` option is crucial. It specifies the routes or paths that this middleware will affect.  In this example, only requests to `/my-page` will be intercepted and redirected.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/functions/next-response)\n\n\n**Further Considerations:**\n\n* Carefully plan your `matcher` configurations to avoid unintended consequences.  Overly broad matchers can negatively impact performance.\n*  Use middleware sparingly.  It's powerful, but should be reserved for tasks like authentication, authorization, and redirects that affect the entire application flow rather than individual page-specific logic.\n*  Always thoroughly test your middleware to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
