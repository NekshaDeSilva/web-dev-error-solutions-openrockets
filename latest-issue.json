[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Headers already sent` error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to modify HTTP headers after the response has already started being sent to the client. This often happens due to unintended multiple calls to `next.response.setHeader()` or mixing synchronous and asynchronous operations within your middleware.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Headers already sent` error manifests as a server-side error preventing your Next.js application from correctly responding to requests.  It usually arises when you try to set or modify response headers after data has already been written to the response stream. This often prevents the correct setting of cookies, caching headers, or other vital response headers.  The error message itself will vary slightly depending on the server environment, but the core message remains the same.\n\n## Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where we're trying to add a custom header and redirect in our middleware:\n\n**Problem Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value');\n  res.redirect('/another-page'); //This will likely cause the error.\n  //More code that won't execute after the header issue.\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'], // This matches all routes\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Problem:**\n\nIn this example, we are using the `res` object directly, which is not suitable for Next.js Middleware. The `res` object in this context isn't the same as in a typical Node.js server.  Attempting to set a header *after* a redirect (`res.redirect`) is likely to cause the headers-already-sent error because the redirect initiates the response process.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next(); //Creating the response object\n  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value'); //Correct way to set header using NextResponse.\n  //Conditional redirect using NextResponse.redirect\n  if(req.nextUrl.pathname === '/') {\n     return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/another-page', req.url));\n  }\n  return res;\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\n1. **Import `NextResponse`:** We import `NextResponse` from `next/server` to properly handle responses within the middleware.\n2. **Use `NextResponse.next()`:** Instead of directly manipulating `res`, we create a response using `NextResponse.next()`. This ensures the response is managed correctly.\n3. **Use `res.headers.set()`:** We correctly set the headers using `res.headers.set()`.  This is the method provided by `NextResponse`.\n4. **Conditional Redirect with `NextResponse.redirect()`:** We use `NextResponse.redirect()` to handle redirects, preventing the header-sending conflict. This creates a new response object, avoiding conflicts with already-sent headers.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - Official Next.js documentation on Middleware.\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response) - Details about the `NextResponse` object.\n* [Understanding HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) - General information about HTTP Headers.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue is the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests and the limitations of manipulating response objects once the response process has begun. `NextResponse` provides a structured and asynchronous way to handle these operations, preventing the `headersAlreadySent` error.  By using `NextResponse`, you ensure that header modifications and redirects happen before any data is sent to the client, maintaining the integrity of the HTTP response.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
