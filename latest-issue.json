[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when trying to use functionalities from `next/server` within Next.js API routes.  The error typically manifests as a `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` or a similar error indicating that modules from the `next/server` package are not available in the API route context. This is because `next/server` is specifically designed for features related to request handling in the Edge runtime (middleware, etc.), and isn't available within the Node.js environment of API routes.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen you attempt to import and utilize modules from `next/server` (e.g., `NextResponse`) within an API route handler, you'll get an error like:\n\n```bash\nError: Cannot find module 'next/server'\n```\n\nThis happens because API routes run within a standard Node.js environment, not the Edge runtime where `next/server` operates.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's say you have an API route that attempts to use `NextResponse` incorrectly:\n\n**Incorrect Code (api/myroute.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// api/myroute.js (INCORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const response = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from API route!' });\n  return response; // This will cause an error!\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Code (api/myroute.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// api/myroute.js (CORRECT)\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const response = {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello from API route!' })\n  };\n  res.status(response.status).setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json').send(response.body) ;\n  return res;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code directly interacts with the standard `res` object provided by the API route handler.  Instead of relying on `next/server`'s `NextResponse`, we manually construct the response object with the necessary status code, headers, and body. This approach is compatible with the Node.js environment of API routes.  This allows us to create the API response in a way that works correctly within an API route.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) - This link explains the differences between API routes and middleware and the functionalities available in each.\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - This link details the capabilities of Next.js Middleware and the `next/server` modules.\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe key takeaway is to understand the different runtime environments of Next.js API routes and Middleware.  API routes operate within a Node.js context and do not have access to the `next/server` modules.  To handle responses in API routes, you should use the standard Node.js `res` object.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
