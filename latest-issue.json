[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: the dreaded \"headers already sent\" error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to send headers to the client after the response has already begun.  This is often subtle and can be frustrating to debug.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error in Next.js Middleware (and Node.js in general) manifests when you try to modify the response headers after the response stream has already started writing data to the client.  This often happens due to unintentional double-sends or conflicts between middleware and other parts of your application.  The error message itself might vary slightly depending on the server, but the core problem remains the same.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you have middleware that redirects users based on certain conditions, but you also have logging within your `page.js` file that tries to set a custom header after the middleware has already started the redirect. This can cause the conflict.\n\n\n**Step-by-step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume we have a middleware that redirects users to `/login` if they are not authenticated, and a `page.js` file which tries to set a custom header regardless of authentication:\n\n**Problematic Middleware (`middleware.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = req.cookies.get('auth') // Check for authentication cookie\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n}\n```\n\n**Problematic Page (`pages/index.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const res = NextResponse.next(); // Attempting to add a header after middleware redirect\n  res.headers.set(\"X-Custom-Header\", \"MyValue\") // ERROR: Headers already sent\n  return (\n    <h1>Welcome!</h1>\n  )\n}\n\nexport function getServerSideProps(context){\n  const res = context.res;\n  res.setHeader(\"X-Custom-Header\", \"MyValue\") // ERROR: Headers already sent\n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Middleware (`middleware.js`):**  (No changes needed in this case, the problem is in the page)\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = req.cookies.get('auth')\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Page (`pages/index.js`):** We should avoid trying to set the custom header since middleware handles the response. If we need it to apply to only authenticated users, we can set it within the middleware after the authentication check.\n\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <h1>Welcome!</h1>\n  )\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe original code attempts to modify the response headers after the redirect in the middleware has already started sending the response.  This leads to the `headers already sent` error. The corrected version eliminates the conflicting header setting in the page component after the redirect has been initiated.  Instead, if you need custom headers for authenticated users, add header setting within your middleware, *after* the authentication check.  This ensures that headers are set correctly only once and before data is sent to the client.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Node.js Response Object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) (Understanding the underlying response object)\n* [Error Handling in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/handling-errors)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
