[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create a circular progress bar using only CSS.  We'll leverage CSS's `conic-gradient` function for a clean and efficient solution. This technique avoids the need for JavaScript or external libraries, making it lightweight and performant.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe progress bar consists of a circle divided into two parts: a filled segment representing the progress and an empty segment. We use `conic-gradient` to create this division. The `conic-gradient` function takes angles as arguments, allowing us to precisely control the filled portion's size based on a percentage.  We also use some basic CSS for sizing, positioning, and visual enhancements.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CSS Circular Progress Bar</title>\n<style>\n.progress-ring {\n  width: 150px;\n  height: 150px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Light gray background */\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n.progress-ring::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 130px;\n  height: 130px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  background: conic-gradient(\n    #4CAF50 70%, /* Green fill, adjust percentage for progress */\n    #f0f0f0 70%  /* Gray empty part */\n  );\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>Circular Progress Bar (70%)</h1>\n<div class=\"progress-ring\">\n  <div>70%</div> </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.progress-ring`**: This class styles the main container, setting its size, shape (circle using `border-radius`), background color, and centering the inner percentage display using flexbox.\n\n* **`.progress-ring::before`**: This pseudo-element creates the circular progress bar itself. It's positioned absolutely within the parent container, slightly smaller to create a border effect.  The `conic-gradient` is the key:\n\n    * `#4CAF50 70%`: This sets the first color (green) to fill 70% of the circle.  Change this percentage to adjust the progress.\n    * `#f0f0f0 70%`: This sets the remaining portion to light gray. The `70%` here is crucial; it determines where the transition between the colors happens.\n\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on `conic-gradient`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/conic-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/conic-gradient)\n* **CSS-Tricks on Gradients:** [https://css-tricks.com/css-gradients/](https://css-tricks.com/css-gradients/) (For a broader understanding of CSS gradients)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
