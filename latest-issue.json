[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common misconception when using Next.js Middleware: attempting to use `NextResponse.redirect()` within API routes.  While Middleware is designed for modifying requests before they reach your page components or API routes, API routes themselves should handle redirection differently.  Using `NextResponse.redirect()` in an API route will result in a server error.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nAttempting to use `NextResponse.redirect()` inside a Next.js API route will typically throw a server error, often indicating an unexpected response type or a mismatch between the expected JSON response and the redirect attempt. The error message might vary depending on the specific setup, but will generally highlight the incompatibility of `NextResponse` within the API route context.\n\n\n**Incorrect Code (Example):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/redirect.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    // INCORRECT: NextResponse is not available in API routes.\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/somewhere', req.url))\n  }\n  res.status(405).end() // Method Not Allowed\n}\n```\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\n\nInstead of `NextResponse.redirect()`, API routes should utilize the standard `res` object to perform redirects using the appropriate HTTP status code.  Here's the corrected code:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/redirect.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    // CORRECT: Use res.redirect() in API routes.\n    res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/somewhere' })\n    res.end()\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).end() // Method Not Allowed\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/somewhere' })`**: This sets the HTTP status code to 307 (Temporary Redirect) and specifies the redirect location using the `Location` header. The `307` status code ensures that subsequent requests maintain the original HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).  You could also use `302` (Found), but `307` is generally preferred for better consistency.\n* **`res.end()`**: This concludes the response, sending the redirect instruction to the client's browser.\n\nThis approach correctly handles the redirect within the confines of a Next.js API route, avoiding the conflict with `NextResponse`.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction):  The official Next.js documentation for API routes.\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware): The official Next.js documentation for Middleware.\n* [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status): A comprehensive list of HTTP status codes.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Error Handling:** The provided example includes basic error handling for unsupported HTTP methods.  More robust error handling should be implemented in production environments.\n* **Absolute vs. Relative URLs:**  Ensure you are using the correct URL type for your redirect. The example uses a relative path ('/somewhere').  If you need to redirect to an external domain, use an absolute URL.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
