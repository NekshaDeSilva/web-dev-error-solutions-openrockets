[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: unintended infinite redirect loops.  This occurs when your middleware redirects the user repeatedly without a proper exit condition.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error itself might not manifest as a clear error message in your console.  Instead, you'll experience your browser continuously refreshing, often with a spinning loading indicator.  The browser might eventually time out, or you might observe network requests continuously failing or redirecting. This happens because the middleware constantly triggers a new redirect, never allowing the request to reach a stable endpoint or render a page.\n\n## Code Example: Problem and Solution\n\nLet's say you're trying to redirect all requests to `/login` unless the user is authenticated.  The following flawed middleware implementation will cause an infinite redirect loop:\n\n\n**Problematic Middleware (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code checks for a token. If the token is absent, it redirects to `/login`. However, the `/login` page itself might also be protected by this middleware. If the user is *not* logged in, and `GET /login` also lacks a token it will redirect again to `/login` and so on, leading to an infinite loop.\n\n**Solution (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Create a copy of the URL\n\n  if (!token && url.pathname !== '/login') {\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis improved version checks the pathname of the URL *before* redirecting.  If the request is already for `/login`, the middleware does nothing and lets the request proceed. This breaks the redirect loop.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key change is using `req.nextUrl.clone()` and explicitly checking `url.pathname !== '/login'` condition before redirecting. This prevents the middleware from recursively redirecting requests to `/login` again and again.  Creating a clone is crucial; modifying `req.nextUrl` directly can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  (Refer to the official Next.js documentation for comprehensive information on Middleware)\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) (Understanding how API routes interact with Middleware is essential to avoid conflicts)\n\n## Summary\n\nInfinite redirects in Next.js Middleware are a common issue stemming from improperly designed redirect logic within the middleware function.  Always ensure you have a proper exit condition (such as a check on the requested URL) to prevent this type of error. By carefully considering the redirection logic and using the `req.nextUrl.clone()` method, you can ensure that your middleware functions correctly.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
