[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using `NextResponse.redirect` within Next.js Middleware:  redirects to external domains not working as expected.  This often manifests as a redirect loop or the redirect simply not functioning correctly.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen you try to redirect to an external URL using `NextResponse.redirect` in your middleware, the redirect might fail or lead to an infinite redirect loop.  This is because Next.js middleware is designed primarily for internal route manipulation and expects a `NextResponse` object with a destination within the Next.js application.  Redirecting to external domains requires careful handling.\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  if (url.pathname === '/') {\n    url.pathname = 'https://www.example.com'; // Incorrect - external redirect\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code attempts to redirect to `https://www.example.com`, which will likely fail or cause a redirect loop.\n\n**Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Use `NextResponse.rewrite` instead of `NextResponse.redirect` for external URLs:** This is the key to avoiding issues.  `NextResponse.rewrite` performs a server-side rewrite of the request URL, effectively changing the user's view without a redirect in the browser's history.\n\n2. **Ensure proper URL handling:**  Use the full, correctly formatted URL.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  if (url.pathname === '/') {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('https://www.example.com', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code uses `NextResponse.rewrite` to replace the incoming request URL with the external URL. The `new URL('https://www.example.com', req.url)` part is crucial. It constructs a new URL object using the base URL from the original request (`req.url`) to ensure the absolute path is correctly generated, resolving any potential relative path issues.  This avoids unexpected behavior and ensures the redirection functions correctly.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Security:**  Be mindful of security implications when redirecting users to external domains.  Validate external URLs before redirecting to prevent vulnerabilities.\n* **User Experience:**  Consider the user experience. An external redirect might break the user's expected flow and should be implemented thoughtfully.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
