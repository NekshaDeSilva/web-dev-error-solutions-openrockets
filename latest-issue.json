[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using `NextRouter.push` within Next.js applications, particularly within API routes or middleware.  The error message typically reads: `Error: NextRouter.push called with pathname that starts with '/' but is not absolute`.\n\nThis error arises because `NextRouter.push` expects a fully qualified URL, including the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and domain,  when navigating outside the current application context.  Using a relative path (`/some-page`) within an API route or middleware function, which execute outside the client-side rendering environment, will trigger this error.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe core issue is a mismatch between the context where `NextRouter.push` is called and the type of path provided. Client-side routing (within components rendered in the browser) allows relative paths.  However, server-side contexts, such as API routes and middleware, require absolute paths because they don't inherently understand the application's base URL.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you have an API route that needs to redirect the user after a successful action.\n\n**Incorrect Code (Causes the error):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/updateUser.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const { name } = await req.json();\n  // ... update user logic ...\n\n  // INCORRECT: This will throw the error\n  return NextResponse.redirect('/profile'); \n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/updateUser.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const { name } = await req.json();\n  // ... update user logic ...\n\n  const url = new URL('/profile', 'http://localhost:3000'); // Or your production domain\n  return NextResponse.redirect(url);\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe corrected code utilizes the `URL` object to construct a complete URL.  We specify the relative path (`/profile`) and the base URL (`http://localhost:3000`).  Replace `http://localhost:3000` with your actual production domain. This provides `NextResponse.redirect` with the absolute URL it expects, resolving the error.\n\nAlternatively you can use `request.url` if you only need to add query parameters to the current URL:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/updateUser.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const { name } = await req.json();\n  // ... update user logic ...\n\n  const url = new URL(req.url);\n  url.searchParams.append('updated', 'true'); //Append to existing URL.\n  return NextResponse.redirect(url);\n}\n```\n\nThis will redirect the user to the same page but append a query parameter. This is useful for situations where you want to remain on the same page but update some state.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* **NextResponse.redirect Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponseredirect](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponseredirect) (Check for the most up-to-date documentation)\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key takeaway is understanding the context in which you're using `NextRouter.push` or `NextResponse.redirect`.  Within client-side components, relative paths are fine.  But when working with server-side functions like API routes and middleware, always construct a fully qualified absolute URL to avoid this error.  Using the `URL` object provides a robust and clear way to achieve this.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
