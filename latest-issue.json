[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using the `Redirect()` function within Next.js Middleware: unexpected redirect behavior or failures to redirect correctly.  This often stems from misunderstandings about how middleware operates and interacts with the request lifecycle.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error isn't a specific error message, but rather a range of behaviors. You might see:\n\n* **No redirect:** The middleware runs, but the expected redirect doesn't happen, and the user remains on the original page.\n* **Incorrect redirect:** The redirect goes to the wrong URL or behaves unexpectedly.\n* **Infinite redirect loop:**  The middleware continually redirects, resulting in a browser error.\n\n\n**Code Example and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's say we're building a feature where only authenticated users can access `/dashboard`.  A naive implementation might look like this (incorrect):\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token')\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard',\n}\n```\n\nThis *might* seem correct, but it often fails due to how `req.url` works within middleware.  `req.url` contains the *original* requested URL, *not* the URL after any previous redirects.  If the user tries to access `/dashboard` while not logged in, it will perpetually redirect from `/dashboard` to `/login` and back, creating an infinite loop.\n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth_token')\n\n  if (!token) {\n    const loginUrl = new URL('/login', req.nextUrl) //Use req.nextUrl instead of req.url\n    return NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl)\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard',\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe crucial change is replacing `req.url` with `req.nextUrl`.  `req.nextUrl` reflects the URL after any rewriting or redirection steps that may have already occurred in the middleware chain. Using this ensures that the redirect target is calculated correctly, preventing the infinite redirect loop.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/middleware) (Refer to the sections on `NextResponse.redirect` and how middleware operates)\n* **Next.js Request Object:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/request-object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/request-object) (Understand the differences between `req.url` and `req.nextUrl`)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
