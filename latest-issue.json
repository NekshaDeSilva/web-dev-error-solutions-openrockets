[{"body":"\n**Description:**\n\nI'm experiencing unexpected re-renders in a functional component that uses the `useEffect` hook.  The component fetches data from an API and updates its state accordingly.  However, the component seems to re-render multiple times even when the data hasn't changed. This leads to performance issues and unnecessary API calls.\n\n**Code Snippet:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n      const jsonData = await response.json();\n      setData(jsonData);\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []); // Empty dependency array\n\n  if (!data) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Display data here */}\n      {data.map(item => (\n        <p key={item.id}>{item.name}</p>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe component should fetch data once on mount and only re-render when the `data` state actually changes.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe component re-renders multiple times, even though the `data` state remains the same after the initial fetch.  I've inspected the browser's developer tools and can see unnecessary re-renders in the component's lifecycle.\n\n**Possible Causes (My guesses):**\n\n* **Incorrect dependency array:** While I've used an empty array `[]`, I'm unsure if there might be some subtle side effects triggering re-renders.\n* **Unnecessary state updates:**  Perhaps there's a hidden state update elsewhere that's causing this.\n* **React's internal optimizations:**  Could there be a problem with React's reconciliation process?\n\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* React version: 18.2.0\n* Browser: Chrome 114\n* Operating System: macOS Ventura\n\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Clone the repository (link to repo would go here).\n2. Run `npm start`.\n3. Observe the console for unnecessary re-renders.  (Consider using React DevTools for precise tracking)\n\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nI've tried adding `console.log` statements to track state changes and component re-renders, but I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n","number":48,"title":"## Issue: Unexpected re-renders in functional component with useEffect hook"}]
