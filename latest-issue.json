[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`.  This usually happens when you try to access the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property before it's properly defined within the middleware function.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` indicates that the `req.nextUrl` object, specifically its `pathname` property, is undefined when your middleware attempts to access it.  This typically occurs because the middleware is triggered before Next.js has fully processed the request and populated the `nextUrl` object with the necessary information.\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you're trying to redirect users based on their URL path within your middleware:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (incorrect implementation)\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname; // Error happens here!\n\n  if (pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (!req.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/dashboard'],\n};\n```\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Import `NextResponse`:**  Ensure you import `NextResponse` from `next/server`.\n\n2. **Use `NextRequest`'s `nextUrl`:** Access the `pathname` via the `nextUrl` property of the `req` object (which is a `NextRequest` object). Note that direct use of `req.url` will not solve the problem.\n\n3. **Handle undefined cases:** Employ optional chaining (`?.`) or nullish coalescing (`??`) to gracefully handle cases where `req.nextUrl` might still be unexpectedly undefined. A fallback value is crucial for avoiding runtime crashes.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (correct implementation)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname;\n  if (!pathname) {\n    // Handle cases where pathname might be undefined (extra precaution)\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/', req.url));\n  }\n\n  if (pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    if (!req.cookies.get('authToken')) {\n      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*'], // More robust matcher\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code utilizes optional chaining (`?.`) and the `startsWith` method for safer pathname handling. It adds a check for the `pathname` itself being undefined to handle edge cases that might not be directly related to the initial problem but could still lead to the same error. This additional check adds an extra layer of resilience, and the `startsWith` method ensures the redirect is triggered for all paths beginning with `/dashboard`, addressing a potential issue with the original matcher.\n\nThe revised `matcher` in the `config` object is more inclusive than the initial one. Using `/dashboard/:path*` ensures that all routes under `/dashboard` (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/profile`) are correctly handled by the middleware.  The original `/dashboard` would only match `/dashboard` exactly.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [NextResponse Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/server-api-utils/next-response)\n\nThis improved solution addresses the core problem and provides more robust error handling, preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring smoother functionality of the middleware.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
