[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js's new `next/font` package within `middleware.js` files.  The problem arises because middleware functions run server-side *before* the application's client-side JavaScript is loaded, including the font loading logic provided by `next/font`.  Attempting to directly access font objects within middleware often results in runtime errors or unexpected behavior.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nYou'll typically see errors related to `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'className')` or similar, indicating that the font object you're trying to access hasn't been initialized yet within the middleware context.  This manifests as unexpected styling or completely missing styles applied using fonts loaded with `next/font`.\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (INCORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  // This will likely fail!\n  const response = NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/page?fontClass=${inter.className}`, req.url));  \n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe solution lies in understanding that middleware operates in a different environment than client-side components.  You cannot directly use font objects loaded via `next/font` within the middleware. Instead, you need to manage font-related logic *after* the page has rendered on the client-side.  Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/page.js\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';\n\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const fontClass = inter.className;\n\n    // Use the fontClass as needed.\n\n  return (\n    <main className={`${fontClass}`}>\n      <h1>This page uses the Inter font</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => router.push(\"/\")}>Go Home</button> </main>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (CORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  //Handle redirects and other middleware logic here that doesn't involve next/font.\n\n  return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code moves all font-related logic into the actual page component (`pages/page.js`).  The middleware now only handles routing and other server-side actions unrelated to `next/font`. This ensures that the font object is correctly initialized and available when the client-side JavaScript runs.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js `next/font` Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
