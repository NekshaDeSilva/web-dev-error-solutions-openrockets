[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using `NextResponse.rewrite` within Next.js Middleware to redirect requests based on dynamic parameters.  The problem arises when attempting to rewrite to a route that includes those same dynamic parameters, but the rewrite URL isn't properly constructed, leading to incorrect or unexpected redirects.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nLet's say you want to rewrite requests to `/product/[id]` based on a specific condition within your middleware.  A common mistake is to directly use the incoming request's `params` object within `NextResponse.rewrite`. This often results in a `404 Not Found` error because the dynamic segment isn't correctly interpreted by the rewrite function.  The middleware's `params` object might not be directly compatible with the `NextResponse.rewrite` URL construction.\n\n**Code (Illustrating the Problem):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (INCORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const { params } = req;\n\n  if (params?.id === 'special-product') {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL(`/product/${params.id}`, req.url)); // Incorrect usage!\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse;\n}\n```\n\nThis code attempts to rewrite `/product/special-product` to itself.  However, it may not function correctly due to how `NextResponse.rewrite` handles dynamic segments.\n\n\n**Fixing the Issue Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Correctly Construct the Rewrite URL:** Instead of directly using `req.url` to create a new `URL`, construct the rewrite URL string manually, ensuring correct formatting for dynamic segments:\n\n2. **Use `req.nextUrl` for better results:** Instead of manipulating the `req.url` directly, use `req.nextUrl` which provides better manipulation capabilities within the Next.js context.\n\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (CORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const { params } = req;\n\n  if (params?.id === 'special-product') {\n      const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n      url.pathname = `/product/special-product`; //Directly setting pathname for clarity\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\n\n```\n\nThis revised code directly sets the pathname of the `req.nextUrl` to the correct path, resolving any issues related to dynamic segments in the rewrite URL. Using `req.nextUrl.clone()` allows safe modification of the URL without affecting other properties.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe original code's error stems from the way `NextResponse.rewrite` interprets dynamic segments. By manually constructing the URL string with the correct path (`/product/special-product`), we bypass potential conflicts and ensure a successful redirect.  Using `req.nextUrl` instead of constructing a URL from scratch offers additional benefit of inheriting properties like search parameters and ensuring proper URL construction within the context of the Next.js environment.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
