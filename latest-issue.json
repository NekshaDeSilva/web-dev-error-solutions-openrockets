[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `headers already sent` error. This typically happens when you try to set headers or send a response multiple times within the same middleware function.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error indicates that your Next.js middleware function has already begun sending a response to the client, but it's attempting to modify headers or send additional data. This usually happens because you've unintentionally called `next()` (or implicitly called it through redirect or rewrite) more than once or you've attempted to write to the response body after headers have been sent.  This is a common problem when you are trying to manipulate headers before routing happens or dealing with asynchronous operations.\n\n\n**Full Code of Fixing Step by Step:**\n\nLet's assume you have a middleware function intended to check for authentication and redirect unauthenticated users:\n\n**Problem Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url); \n  }\n  //This line will cause the error if the redirect above is already processed\n  if (token === \"invalid\"){\n      return new NextResponse(\"Unauthorized\", { status: 401});\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/profile'],\n}\n```\n\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url); \n  }\n\n  //Early exit to prevent multiple responses\n  if (token === \"invalid\"){\n      return new NextResponse(\"Unauthorized\", { status: 401});\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/profile'],\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe problem lies in having multiple `return` statements that send responses within the middleware.  In the corrected code, we added conditional checks. If an unauthenticated user is detected, a redirect is performed, and the function immediately terminates using the `return` statement. This prevents the subsequent check for an invalid token from executing after a response has already been sent.  Only one response is allowed per middleware execution.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/handling-errors)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
