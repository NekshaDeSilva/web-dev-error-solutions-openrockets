[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The effect involves a card that, on hover, expands to reveal additional content smoothly and subtly.  We'll be using CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe styling creates a card with a header and a body.  The body initially hides its content. On hover, the card expands horizontally, and the body content smoothly slides into view.  The transition is made smooth using CSS transitions.  A subtle box-shadow effect is added to enhance the card's appearance.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */\n  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 450px; /* Expanded width */\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-header {\n  background-color: #4CAF50;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 15px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.card-body {\n  padding: 15px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for content */\n  transform: translateX(150px); /* Initially hidden */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-body {\n  transform: translateX(0); /* Reveal content on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">\n    <h3>Expanding Card</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n    <p>This is the content of the expanding card.  It's initially hidden and slides in on hover.  You can add as much content as you like here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition` property:**  This is crucial for the smooth animation.  It specifies which properties (width, box-shadow, transform) should be transitioned, the duration (0.3s), and the easing function (`ease-in-out`).\n\n* **`transform: translateX()`:** This property moves the card body horizontally.  The initial `translateX(150px)` hides the content, and `translateX(0)` on hover brings it into view.\n\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** This prevents the content from peeking out before the transition is complete.\n\n* **Box-shadow:** This adds depth and visual appeal to the card.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
