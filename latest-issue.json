[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the \"headers already sent\" error. This typically occurs when you attempt to set headers after the response has already begun being sent to the client.  This is especially problematic in situations where you might be conditionally setting headers or encountering unexpected behavior within your middleware.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe \"headers already sent\" error is a generic HTTP error that arises when your server tries to modify HTTP headers after it has already started sending the response body to the client.  In Next.js Middleware, this can happen if you inadvertently send data to the response stream (e.g., by accidentally logging to the console or using `console.log` within your middleware function) before setting headers, or if multiple middleware functions attempt to modify headers concurrently.\n\n**Code Example Demonstrating the Error (and its fix):**\n\n\n**Problem Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/myroute.js (API Route)\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  console.log('API Route called'); // This can sometimes trigger the error\n  res.status(200).json({ text: 'Hello' });\n}\n\n// pages/middleware.js (Middleware)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  // Problem: Setting headers AFTER sending data to the client (implicitly via console.log)\n  // This is unpredictable, as the API route console log might execute before the middleware\n  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'Middleware Value');\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/myroute',\n};\n```\n\n\n**Solution Code (Step-by-Step):**\n\n1. **Identify the source:** Carefully examine your API route and middleware functions for any unintended operations happening *before* `res.setHeader` or `res.status`.  Console logging (`console.log`) is a frequent culprit.  Sometimes, even seemingly harmless side effects can push the response to start early and trigger the error.\n\n2. **Centralize Header Management:**  Instead of setting headers in multiple places, consolidate the header setting logic into a single location.  This improves code clarity and reduces the risk of conflicts.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:** Make absolutely sure that any header setting happens *before* any content is written to the response (or implicitly sent through things like `console.log` in the API route).\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/myroute.js (API Route)\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // Removed console.log to prevent early response sending\n  res.status(200).json({ text: 'Hello' });\n}\n\n// pages/middleware.js (Middleware)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  // Solution: Set headers first, THEN call NextResponse.next()\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'Middleware Value');\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/myroute',\n};\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code ensures that the headers are set *before* any part of the response is sent.  By moving `res.headers.set` above `return res;` we ensure the headers are set correctly before Next.js proceeds with handling the request.  The removal of the `console.log` from the API route makes it much less likely that an early response is triggered, resolving the conflict between middleware and API routes.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - Official Next.js documentation on middleware.\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) - Official Next.js documentation on API routes.\n* [HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) - A general overview of HTTP headers.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
