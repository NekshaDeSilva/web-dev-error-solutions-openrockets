[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands to reveal hidden content upon hover, offering a smooth, visually appealing transition.  We'll leverage CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this effect without JavaScript.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will initially appear compact, displaying only a title and a small preview image. On hover, the card will smoothly expand vertically, revealing additional content (a longer description in this example). The expansion is accompanied by a subtle fade-in effect for the expanded content.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth height transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.card-image {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100px;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-description {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth opacity transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-description {\n  opacity: 1; /* Fade in description on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x100\" alt=\"Card Image\" class=\"card-image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h3>\n    <p class=\"card-description\">This is a longer description that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  It smoothly fades in to enhance the user experience.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`:** This line applies a smooth transition to the `height` property, making the expansion visually appealing.  The `0.3s` specifies the duration, and `ease-in-out` defines the easing function.\n* **`height: 300px;` (inside `:hover`):** This increases the card's height on hover, revealing the hidden content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents content from overflowing the card's initial boundaries before expansion.\n* **`opacity: 0;` and `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;` (on `.card-description`):** These lines control the fade-in effect for the description.  Initially, it has zero opacity (hidden), and the transition smoothly changes its opacity to 1 (fully visible) on hover.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (A great resource for various CSS techniques)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
