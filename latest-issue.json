[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required!  This effect utilizes CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to create a smooth and visually appealing expansion on mouse hover.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a compact state.  On hover, the card expands horizontally, revealing more content.  This is achieved using CSS transitions on the `width` property and strategically placed content within the card.  We use a simple and clean design, focusing on the expanding functionality itself.  The color scheme is intentionally minimalistic for clarity.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CSS Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  width: 200px;\n  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition on width change */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 400px; /* Expands to double the width on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This card expands horizontally on hover, revealing more content.  This effect is achieved purely with CSS, using transitions and the :hover pseudo-class. No JavaScript is required!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card element.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from spilling outside the card during the expansion.  The `transition` property smoothly animates the width change over 0.3 seconds.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This applies styles when the mouse hovers over the `.card` element.  The `width` is increased, triggering the transition.\n* **`.card-content`, `.card-title`, `.card-text`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and structure.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n* **Learn CSS:** [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
