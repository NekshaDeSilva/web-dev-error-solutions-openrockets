[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when attempting to embed a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart's container.  The issue often manifests as the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render correctly, leaving a blank space where the video should be. This usually happens because VideoJS requires a properly sized and rendered DOM element to function correctly, and CanvasJS might not provide this immediately or in the way VideoJS expects, especially if there are asynchronous rendering operations.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error isn't a specific JavaScript error message, but rather a visual one: the VideoJS player either doesn't appear at all or shows a broken/empty placeholder within the designated CanvasJS chart container.  The browser's developer console may be silent, or may show unrelated warnings unrelated to the core issue. This is often due to a race condition where VideoJS attempts initialization before the CanvasJS chart has fully rendered the container element.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis solution uses a technique to ensure the CanvasJS chart is fully rendered before initializing the VideoJS player. We leverage the `afterSetOptions` event provided by CanvasJS.\n\n```javascript\n// Include necessary libraries (ensure correct paths)\n// <script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n// <script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.19.2/video.min.js\"></script>\n\nwindow.onload = function () {\n\n  // CanvasJS Chart setup\n  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    // ... your CanvasJS chart options ...\n    animationEnabled: true,\n    title: {\n      text: \"My Chart\"\n    },\n    data: [\n      // ... your data points ...\n    ],\n    afterSetOptions: function(){\n      initializeVideoJS();\n    }\n  });\n  chart.render();\n\n  function initializeVideoJS() {\n    // VideoJS Player setup\n    var player = videojs('myVideo', {\n      sources: [{\n        src: 'your_video.mp4',\n        type: 'video/mp4'\n      }],\n      autoplay: false,\n      controls: true\n    });\n    //Optional: Handle potential errors gracefully\n    player.on('error', function(error){\n      console.error(\"VideoJS Error:\", error);\n      //Add any desired error handling logic.  For example, display an alternative message to the user.\n    });\n  }\n};\n\n\n```\n\n**HTML Structure (Important):** Make sure you have a `<div>` with the ID `chartContainer` and another nested `<video>` element with the ID `myVideo` within the `chartContainer`.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\">\n    <video id=\"myVideo\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></video>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key to the solution is using the `afterSetOptions` callback within the CanvasJS chart configuration.  This callback function executes *after* CanvasJS has finished setting up its internal elements and rendered the chart to the DOM. This guarantees that the `chartContainer` div exists and is properly sized before the VideoJS player initialization (`initializeVideoJS` function) is called.  This avoids the race condition and ensures the player can access a valid container element.  The use of  `window.onload` ensures the DOM is fully loaded before trying to access and modify elements.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/docs/](https://canvasjs.com/docs/) (Check for documentation on events and rendering lifecycle)\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/) (Check for troubleshooting and API references)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
