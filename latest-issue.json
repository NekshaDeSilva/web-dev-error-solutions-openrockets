[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  This example uses only CSS3 properties, avoiding any JavaScript.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling relies primarily on the `height` property and transitions.  The card starts with a smaller height, only showing a title and a small portion of the content. On hover, the `height` transitions smoothly to a larger value, revealing the full content.  We also use `overflow: hidden` initially to hide the extra content and a subtle box-shadow to enhance the card's appearance.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 250px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height of the content; Adjust as needed */\n  overflow: auto; /* Allows scrolling if the content exceeds the height */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is the content of the expanding card.  You can add as much text as you like here, and it will smoothly expand on hover. This demonstrates a simple but effective CSS-only animation.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial. It tells the browser to smoothly animate the change in the `height` property over 0.3 seconds, using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function for a natural feel.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the content from overflowing the initial smaller height of the card.\n* **`height: 100px;` (in `.card` and `.card-text`)**:  Sets the initial height of the card and the content area. Adjust these values to control the starting size.\n* **`height: 250px;` (in `.card:hover`)**:  This sets the height of the card when the user hovers over it. Adjust this value to control the expanded size.\n* **`overflow: auto;` (in `.card-text`)**: This ensures that if the content exceeds the expanded height, a scrollbar will appear.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transitions and Animations:** [W3Schools - CSS Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
