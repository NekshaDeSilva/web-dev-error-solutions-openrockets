[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The card expands smoothly on hover, revealing hidden content, and utilizes a simple animation for a more engaging user experience.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThis effect leverages CSS transitions and transforms to create the expansion animation.  The card initially displays a smaller size and, on hover, expands to reveal additional content. A subtle box-shadow is added to enhance the card's appearance.  The animation is smooth and controlled, ensuring a pleasant user experience.  This example doesn't use a specific CSS framework like Tailwind, focusing on pure CSS for better understanding of the underlying principles.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content outside the initial card size */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  height: 100%; /* Occupies full card height initially*/\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute space between header and hidden content */\n\n}\n\n.card-header {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.hidden-content {\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */\n  height: 0; /* Initially zero height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth height transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .hidden-content {\n  height: 100px; /* Expand height on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <div class=\"card-header\">Card Title</div>\n    <div class=\"hidden-content\">\n      This is some hidden content that will be revealed on hover.  This allows for a clean and engaging user experience.\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition` property:** This allows smooth animations for `transform` and `box-shadow` properties. The `ease-in-out` timing function provides a natural-feeling animation.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1);`:** This scales the card up by 10% on hover, creating the expansion effect.\n* **`box-shadow`:**  Provides a subtle shadow, which is enhanced on hover.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:**  Prevents the hidden content from overflowing the initial card size.\n* **Height transition on `.hidden-content`:**  The height of the hidden content is initially zero, and transitions to 100px on hover, revealing the content smoothly.\n* **`flex-direction: column;` and `justify-content: space-between;`**:These are used within the `.card-content` to properly align the header and hidden content vertically\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (A great resource for various CSS techniques)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
