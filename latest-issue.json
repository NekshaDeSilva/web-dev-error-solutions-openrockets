[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically to reveal hidden content when hovered over, providing a smooth, visually appealing user interaction without any JavaScript.  We'll be using primarily CSS3 for this effect.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe core of the effect relies on CSS transitions and the `max-height` property.  The card initially has a fixed `max-height` that restricts its height. On hover, the `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand, creating the reveal animation.  We'll also utilize subtle box-shadow transitions for a more polished feel.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, max-height 0.5s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  max-height: 300px; /* Height when hovered */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>This is the card title</h2>\n    <p>This is some example text that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  You can add as much content as you need here.  The card will smoothly expand to accommodate it.</p>\n    <p>More example text to demonstrate the expanding effect.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from spilling outside the card before it expands.  `max-height` initially limits the card's height. The `transition` property defines the smooth animation for `box-shadow` and `max-height`.\n\n* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `max-height` is increased, triggering the expansion. The box-shadow is also intensified to give a more pronounced hover effect.\n\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content within the card, adding padding for readability.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Box-shadow:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n* **Understanding CSS Selectors:** [A good tutorial on CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) (Choose a reputable tutorial based on your preferred learning style)\n\nThis example provides a basic expanding card. You can customize it further by changing colors, adding animations, and incorporating more advanced CSS techniques.  Remember to adjust the `max-height` values to fit your content's dimensions.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
