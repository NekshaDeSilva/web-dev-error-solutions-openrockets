[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using asynchronous functions within Next.js API routes: `ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined`. This error typically arises because asynchronous functions (using `async`/`await`) rely on the `regeneratorRuntime` object, which isn't automatically available in all Node.js environments.  Next.js API routes run in a Node.js environment, and if the necessary runtime isn't included, this error will occur.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined` error message indicates that the JavaScript engine executing your API route code cannot find the `regeneratorRuntime` object, which is essential for handling asynchronous operations using `async`/`await`. This usually happens when you're using a transpiler like Babel without the correct plugins configured.\n\n\n**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**\n\nThis error can be fixed by installing and properly configuring the `regenerator-runtime` package. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n\n1. **Install the package:**\n\n   Open your terminal and navigate to your Next.js project's root directory. Then, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install regenerator-runtime --save\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   yarn add regenerator-runtime\n   ```\n\n2. **Import and use `regeneratorRuntime`:**\n\n   Now, at the top of your API route file, import and use `regeneratorRuntime`.  Even if you don't explicitly use `async`/`await` in your main function, ensure the `regeneratorRuntime` import is placed, to handle any asynchronous functions called within it.  Here's an example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // pages/api/my-route.js\n   import regeneratorRuntime from 'regenerator-runtime';\n\n   export default async function handler(req, res) {\n     try {\n       // Your API route logic using async/await\n       const data = await fetchData(); // Example asynchronous operation\n       res.status(200).json({ data });\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error(\"Error in API route:\", error);\n       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });\n     }\n   }\n\n   async function fetchData() {\n      // ...your async function to fetch data.\n      return { message: \"Data fetched successfully!\"};\n   }\n   ```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `regeneratorRuntime` object provides the necessary polyfills to support `async`/`await` functionality in older JavaScript environments or environments that don't natively support this feature. By importing and using it, you ensure that your asynchronous code functions correctly within your Next.js API route.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [regenerator-runtime npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regenerator-runtime)\n* [Understanding Async/Await in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)\n\n\n**Important Note:** If you still face the error after following these steps, double-check your project's Babel configuration (if you are using Babel) to make sure it's properly transpiling your code.  Ensure you don't have conflicting configurations or missing plugins that could interfere with the `regeneratorRuntime` integration.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
