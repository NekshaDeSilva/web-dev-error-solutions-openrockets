[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. The card expands to reveal additional content on hover, employing a smooth transition for a polished user experience.  We'll be using plain CSS (no CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less, and no frameworks like Tailwind CSS) for this example to demonstrate the core concepts.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a single `<div>` element to contain the entire structure.  The front of the card displays a title and a brief summary.  On hover, the card expands vertically, revealing hidden content below.  The expansion is animated using CSS transitions.  A subtle shadow effect is added to enhance the three-dimensional look.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the content initially */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 400px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-summary {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-details {\n  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflow */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-details {\n  height: 150px; /* Reveal details on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-summary\">This is a simple example of an expanding card created using only CSS.  Hover over the card to see it in action!</p>\n    <div class=\"card-details\">\n      <p>This is the hidden content that is revealed when you hover over the card. You can add any content you want here, like more details, images, or anything else.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This is crucial for hiding the content initially and preventing the card from expanding beyond its initial height before the hover effect is triggered.\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line adds a smooth transition to the height change, making the expansion visually appealing.  Adjust the duration (`0.3s`) and easing function (`ease-in-out`) to your liking.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector targets the `.card` element when the mouse hovers over it.\n* **`height: 0;` (on `.card-details`)**:  Keeps the details section collapsed initially.\n* **`height: 150px;` (on `.card:hover .card-details`)**: Sets the height when hovering to reveal the content. Adjust this value as needed.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks - CSS Transitions and Transforms:** [https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
