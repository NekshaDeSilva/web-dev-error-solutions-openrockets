[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This effect is achieved through clever use of transitions and pseudo-elements, offering a clean and performant solution without JavaScript.  We'll use plain CSS3 for this example, although similar effects can be achieved using CSS preprocessors like Sass or frameworks like Tailwind CSS (with slightly different syntax).\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a collapsed state. On hover, it smoothly expands to reveal hidden content. This expansion includes a scaling effect and a subtle fade-in of the hidden content. The design emphasizes clean lines and subtle animations for a modern feel.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```css\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content outside the initial dimensions */\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for all properties */\n  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of the content */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand on hover */\n  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* Add a subtle shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth opacity transition */\n  padding: 20px;\n  background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.9); /* Slightly transparent background */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Reveal content on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 1em;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```\n\n**HTML Structure (example):**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some example text for the card.  It expands on hover to reveal more content.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the smooth animation.  It applies to all properties (`all`) with a duration of 0.3 seconds and an `ease-in-out` timing function.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This scales the card up slightly on hover, creating the expansion effect.\n* **`opacity` property:** This controls the visibility of the `.card-content` which is initially hidden.  The transition on opacity creates a fade-in effect.\n* **`position: absolute` and `position: relative`:**  Positioning is key to ensure the content stays within the card bounds, even when it expands. The parent element needs `position: relative` for the absolute positioning to work correctly.\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** This prevents content from overflowing the card before expansion.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [CSS-Tricks - Smooth Transitions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
