[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of a pulsating heart animation using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required.  This effect utilizes CSS animations and keyframes to create a smooth, rhythmic pulse.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe heart is created using a pseudo-element (`::before` and `::after`) on a parent element.  These pseudo-elements are shaped using border-radius and positioned absolutely to form the heart shape.  The `animation` property applies the `pulse` animation, which smoothly changes the transform scale to create the pulsating effect.  We'll use Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and utility classes.\n\n\n**Full Code (using Tailwind CSS):**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"relative inline-block w-12 h-12\">\n  <div class=\"absolute w-full h-full rounded-full bg-red-500 animate-pulse\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n```css\n/* Tailwind Styles (This is implicitly included if you're using Tailwind.  No extra CSS file needed.)*/\n@layer base {\n  .animate-pulse {\n    animation: pulse 1s ease-in-out infinite;\n  }\n  @keyframes pulse {\n    0%, 100% {\n      transform: scale(1);\n    }\n    50% {\n      transform: scale(1.1);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`relative inline-block`:** This sets the parent div to be positioned relative (so absolute positioning for the child works) and inline-block (to allow other content to flow around it). `w-12` and `h-12` set the width and height to 12 units (Tailwind's default unit is usually 4px, but it can be customized).\n* **`absolute w-full h-full rounded-full bg-red-500`:** The inner div is absolutely positioned within its parent, filling its parent's size (`w-full`, `h-full`), rounded to form a circle (`rounded-full`), and colored red (`bg-red-500`).\n* **`animate-pulse`:** This class applies the `pulse` animation.\n* **`@keyframes pulse`:** This defines the animation. It smoothly scales the element from 100% to 110% and back over 1 second, creating the pulsing effect.  The `infinite` keyword makes the animation loop continuously.\n* **`ease-in-out`:** This provides a smooth acceleration and deceleration during the animation.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Learn more about Tailwind CSS classes and utilities.\n* **CSS Animations MDN:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) - Comprehensive documentation on CSS animations.\n* **CSS Keyframes MDN:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) - Learn about defining custom keyframes for animations.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
