[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'play')\" error in Video.js frequently arises when attempting to interact with the player's `play()` method before the player is fully initialized or loaded. This usually happens when you try to trigger playback prematurely, often within an event handler that fires *before* the Video.js player has finished setting up its internal components.  The player's internal `player` object is still `undefined`, hence the error when you try to access its `.play()` method.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you have a basic Video.js setup like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Video.js Example</title>\n<script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js\"></script>\n<link href=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\" data-setup='{\"sources\": [{\"src\": \"myvideo.mp4\", \"type\": \"video/mp4\"}]}'>\n  <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a></p>\n</video>\n\n<script>\n  var player = videojs('my-video');\n  // Incorrect placement of play() - this will likely cause the error\n  player.play();  \n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe problem lies in calling `player.play()` directly after creating the `player` object. Video.js needs time to initialize.  Here's the corrected code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Video.js Example</title>\n<script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.js\"></script>\n<link href=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\" data-setup='{\"sources\": [{\"src\": \"myvideo.mp4\", \"type\": \"video/mp4\"}]}'>\n  <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a></p>\n</video>\n\n<script>\n  var player = videojs('my-video');\n\n  // Use the 'ready' event to ensure the player is initialized\n  player.ready(function(){\n    this.play();\n  });\n\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe key change is using the `player.ready()` method. This ensures that the `play()` method is called only after the Video.js player has fully loaded and is ready to receive commands.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `ready` event is a Video.js event that fires when the player is completely initialized. By placing the `play()` call inside the `ready` callback function, we guarantee that the player object is fully defined and ready to accept the `play()` command, preventing the \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'play')\" error.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Video.js Documentation:** [https://docs.videojs.com/](https://docs.videojs.com/)  (Look for information on events and player lifecycle)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
