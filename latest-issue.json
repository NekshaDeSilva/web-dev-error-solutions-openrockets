[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with Next.js Middleware, specifically the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')`. This typically occurs when attempting to access the `req.nextUrl.pathname` property before it's properly defined within the middleware function.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pathname')` signifies that the `req.nextUrl` object, and consequently its `pathname` property, is undefined at the point where your middleware attempts to access it. This often happens because the middleware is triggered before the `nextUrl` object is fully populated with request information.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you have a middleware function that attempts to redirect users based on the pathname:\n\n**Incorrect Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const pathname = req.nextUrl.pathname; // Error occurs here!\n\n  if (pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    //Check if user is authenticated, etc.  For now we just redirect for demonstration.\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/dashboard'],\n};\n```\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that you access `req.nextUrl` *after* Next.js has fully populated it. This is typically done within an async function to allow for asynchronous operations:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone(); // Clone the URL to avoid modifying the original\n  const pathname = url.pathname;\n\n  if (pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    //Check if user is authenticated, etc. For now we just redirect for demonstration.\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url))\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next(); //Important!  If you don't return NextResponse.next(), the request won't continue.\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/dashboard'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key change is the use of `req.nextUrl.clone()`.  The `req.nextUrl` object is read-only. Creating a clone allows you to safely manipulate the URL object without impacting the original request.  This is crucial for preventing unexpected behavior or further errors.  Also, the inclusion of `return NextResponse.next();` is critical; this allows the request to proceed to the next stage in the request pipeline.  Without it, the request might be stalled or return an error.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [NextResponse Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Remember that middleware runs before many aspects of the request are complete.  Use `async/await` for any operations that might take time, such as database queries or external API calls.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling within your middleware to catch unexpected issues and prevent the application from crashing.\n* **`matcher` Configuration:** Carefully define your `matcher` to apply middleware only to the necessary routes.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
