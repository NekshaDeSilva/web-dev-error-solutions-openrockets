[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem when using the `dotenv` package in Node.js is encountering an error where environment variables defined in your `.env` file are not being loaded correctly into your application. This typically manifests as `ReferenceError: process.env.MY_VARIABLE is not defined` or similar errors, even if you've seemingly configured `dotenv` correctly.  This can be caused by several factors, including incorrect file paths, improper loading order, or issues with the `.env` file itself.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you have a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the following content:\n\n```.env\nDATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase\nAPI_KEY=your_api_key\n```\n\nAnd you're trying to access these variables in your `index.js` file.\n\n**Incorrect (and common) Implementation:**\n\n```javascript\n// index.js (INCORRECT)\nconsole.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL); // Often fails here\nconsole.log(process.env.API_KEY);\n```\n\n**Correct Implementation:**\n\n```javascript\n// index.js (CORRECT)\nrequire('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env\n\nconsole.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL); \nconsole.log(process.env.API_KEY);\n\n\n//Example usage in ExpressJS:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000; //using env variable for port, defaults to 3000\n\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello from Express!');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\nThe key change is adding `require('dotenv').config();` at the very beginning of your main file (or wherever you need to access the environment variables).  This line tells `dotenv` to load the environment variables from the `.env` file located in the same directory as the executing script.  If your `.env` file is in a different location you'll need to specify the `path` option in `.config()`.  For example `require('dotenv').config({path: './config/.env'});`.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **`dotenv` npm package:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)  -  This link provides documentation and installation instructions for the `dotenv` package.\n\n* **Node.js documentation on `process.env`:** [https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv) - This shows how Node.js handles environment variables.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `dotenv` package simplifies the process of managing environment variables within your Node.js application.  By loading these variables from a `.env` file, you keep sensitive information like API keys out of your version control system and make it easier to manage different configurations (development, staging, production) without modifying your code directly.  It's crucial to make sure that `dotenv` is called *before* you try to access any of the environment variables otherwise they will not be defined.\n\nTroubleshooting tips:\n\n* **Verify `.env` file location:** Double-check the path to your `.env` file.\n* **Check for typos:** Ensure the variable names in your code match exactly the names in your `.env` file (case-sensitive).\n* **Restart your application:** After making changes, restart your Node.js application to ensure the changes are reflected.\n* **File Permissions:**  Make sure the `.env` file has appropriate read permissions.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
