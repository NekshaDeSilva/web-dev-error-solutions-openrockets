[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect, a common interactive element in web design.  This example uses only CSS3, avoiding the need for JavaScript.  The effect involves a card that expands to reveal more content when hovered over.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling leverages CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to achieve the animation. The card starts with a smaller height and then expands vertically on hover.  We'll use simple box-shadow to give it a bit of depth, and some padding for visual comfort.  The inner content will be hidden initially and then revealed with the height expansion.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n    font-size: 1em;\n    line-height: 1.6;\n}\n\n.hidden {\n    overflow: hidden;\n    height: 0; /* Initially hidden content */\n    transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover .hidden {\n    height: auto;  /* Show content on hover */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some example text that will be hidden initially and revealed when you hover over the card.  You can add as much text as you like here.</p>\n    <p class=\"hidden\">This is additional hidden content. It will only be visible on hover.</p>\n    <p class=\"hidden\">More hidden content here to demonstrate the expansion!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line creates a smooth transition for the `height` property over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`:hover`**: This pseudo-class applies the styles within its block only when the element is hovered over.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**:  This is crucial on the `card` and initially on the hidden content (`hidden` class). It prevents content from spilling outside the card's boundaries during the transition.\n* **`.hidden` class**: This class is used to initially hide the content using `height: 0`. The hover state removes this limitation allowing the text to flow freely based on its natural size.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n* **CSS `overflow` property:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
