[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: **rate limits**.  Discord implements rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of its servers.  Exceeding these limits results in your bot being temporarily banned from sending messages or performing other actions.  This guide provides a practical solution to manage and avoid these limits effectively.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen your bot attempts to send messages, edit messages, or perform other actions too quickly, you'll likely encounter a `DiscordAPIError` with a code related to rate limits. This error might manifest as:\n\n* **`DiscordAPIError: 429`**: This is the most common rate limit error code.\n*  Other errors mentioning \"rate limited\" or exceeding allowed requests per second/minute.\n* Your bot may appear to stop responding or show inconsistent behaviour.\n\n\n## Code: Handling Rate Limits with `setTimeout`\n\nThis example demonstrates a simple, yet effective way to handle rate limits using `setTimeout` to introduce delays between actions.  This approach is suitable for many scenarios, but for highly complex bots, more sophisticated rate limit management libraries may be necessary.\n\n```javascript\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Discord.Client({ intents: [Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Discord.Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] }); // Adjust intents as needed\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\n//Example: Sending multiple messages with rate limit handling\nasync function sendMessageWithDelay(channel, messages) {\n  for (const message of messages) {\n    try {\n      await channel.send(message);\n      // Introduce a delay to avoid rate limits. Adjust the delay as needed.\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // 1-second delay\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code === 50013) { //Missing Access\n        console.error(\"Missing Access! Check your bot's permissions\")\n      } else if (error.code === 429) {\n        console.error('Rate limited! Retrying after 2 seconds...');\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); //2-second delay after rate limit\n        await channel.send(message);\n      } else {\n        console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', msg => {\n  if (msg.content === '!send') {\n    const messagesToSend = ['Message 1', 'Message 2', 'Message 3', 'Message 4', 'Message 5'];\n    sendMessageWithDelay(msg.channel, messagesToSend);\n  }\n});\n\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace with your bot token\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **Import Discord.js:**  The code begins by importing the necessary Discord.js library.\n2. **Create Client:** A new Discord client instance is created with the required intents.  Make sure you have the right intents enabled for your bot's functionality.\n3. **`sendMessageWithDelay` Function:** This function iterates through an array of messages.  Before sending each message, it uses `setTimeout` to pause execution for 1 second.  This ensures that messages aren't sent too rapidly.  Crucially, it also includes error handling for rate limits (code 429) and waits for an additional 2 seconds in this case.\n4. **Event Listener:** The `messageCreate` event listener listens for messages in the server. If the message content is '!send', it calls the `sendMessageWithDelay` function.\n5. **Error Handling:** The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during message sending.  Specifically, it looks for the `429` error code and adds a longer delay, allowing the bot to recover from rate limits gracefully.\n6. **Bot Login:**  Finally, the bot logs in using your bot token.  Remember to replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Guide:** [https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) (General Discord.js documentation)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) (Official Discord API documentation on rate limits)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
