[{"body":"\nThis challenge involves creating a responsive card grid using Tailwind CSS. The grid should dynamically adjust the number of columns based on the screen size, ensuring cards always maintain a consistent aspect ratio and spacing.  We'll aim for a clean, modern aesthetic.\n\n## Description of the Styling:\n\nThe design will use Tailwind's responsive utility classes to create a grid of cards.  The cards will have a consistent aspect ratio (e.g., 2:1), maintaining their proportions across different screen sizes.  We'll utilize Tailwind's spacing and border utilities for visual appeal and consistency. The cards themselves will have a simple, clean design with a subtle background color and dark text. The layout will adapt smoothly from a single column on smaller screens to multiple columns on larger screens.\n\n\n## Full Code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <title>Responsive Card Grid</title>\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n  <div class=\"container mx-auto px-4 py-8\">\n    <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4\">\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card 1</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card 2</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card 3</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6\">\n        <h2 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-2\">Card 4</h2>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700\">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>\n      </div>\n      <!-- Add more cards as needed -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n* **`container mx-auto px-4 py-8`**: This centers the content horizontally and adds padding.\n* **`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`**: This creates the responsive grid.  `grid-cols-1` sets a single column by default.  The `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` prefixes apply the specified number of columns at different screen sizes (using Tailwind's breakpoint system). `gap-4` adds spacing between the cards.\n* **`bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6`**: These classes style each card with a white background, rounded corners, a shadow, and padding.\n* **`text-xl font-semibold mb-2`**: Styles the card title.\n* **`text-gray-700`**: Styles the card text.\n\nRemember to include the Tailwind CSS CDN link in your `<head>` to use these classes.  You can easily add or remove cards by duplicating the card div elements.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More:\n\n* **Tailwind CSS Documentation:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)  - Comprehensive documentation on all Tailwind CSS utilities and features.\n* **Tailwind CSS Grid System:** [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid) -  Specific documentation on Tailwind's powerful grid system.\n* **CSS Grid Layout (general):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Learn the fundamentals of CSS Grid, which Tailwind builds upon.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
