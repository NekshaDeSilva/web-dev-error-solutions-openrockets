[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using `NextResponse.redirect` within Next.js Middleware: unintended redirects or redirects not working as expected.  This often stems from a misunderstanding of how middleware operates and interacts with requests and responses.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe most prevalent issue is a redirect loop.  This happens when a middleware function redirects to a route that, in turn, triggers the same middleware again, creating an endless redirect cycle. This typically manifests as an error in the browser console, indicating a \"too many redirects\" error or a page that never loads.  Another common problem is an incorrect redirect URL leading to a 404 error or an unexpected page.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume we have middleware intended to redirect all requests to `/blog` unless they already start with `/blog/`.\n\n**Problematic Middleware (Creates a Redirect Loop):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  if (!req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog/')) {\n    url.pathname = '/blog';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url);\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n**This code is flawed because the redirect to `/blog` will trigger the middleware again, leading to an infinite loop.**\n\n**Corrected Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  if (!req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog/')) {\n    url.pathname = '/blog'; //The destination of the redirect.\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(url); // Use NextResponse.rewrite instead of redirect.\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next(); //Explicitly allow requests that start with /blog/\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/', //Applies to all routes\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation of the fix:**\n\n1. **`NextResponse.rewrite` instead of `NextResponse.redirect`:** The key change is using `NextResponse.rewrite`.  `redirect` initiates a full HTTP redirect (307 or 308), causing the browser to make a new request to the specified URL. This can trigger the middleware again, as it's attached to the root path. `rewrite`, on the other hand, internally rewrites the request URL within Next.js, thus avoiding the redirect loop.\n\n2. **Explicit `NextResponse.next()`:** Added `NextResponse.next()` to explicitly handle requests that already match the `/blog/` prefix. This ensures that those requests are not further processed by the middleware. Otherwise, these requests would needlessly cause extra computations even if they are not redirected.\n\n3. **Matcher configuration:** The `matcher` configuration ensures that the middleware applies to all routes. Adjust this if you need more granular control.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - Official Next.js documentation on middleware.\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse) -  Details on `NextResponse` methods.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core issue lies in understanding the difference between `NextResponse.redirect` and `NextResponse.rewrite`.  `redirect` sends a true HTTP redirect to the client's browser; this starts a completely new request. `rewrite`, however, handles the redirection within the Next.js framework, preventing the middleware from being triggered again unnecessarily.  Combining this with explicit handling of routes that shouldn't be redirected prevents infinite loops and ensures proper behavior.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
