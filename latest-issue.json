[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The effect involves a smooth expansion of the card content when hovered over, revealing hidden text and subtly animating the background color.  This is achieved without JavaScript, leveraging CSS transitions and transforms.  We'll use plain CSS3; no frameworks like Tailwind are needed.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a collapsed state.  On hover, the card's height expands to reveal additional content. Simultaneously, the background color subtly changes to a darker shade, enhancing the visual feedback.  The expansion uses a CSS transition for a smooth animation.  We use flexbox for easy layout management.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CSS Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content overflow during transition */\n  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column; /* Stack items vertically */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  background-color: #ddd;\n  height: 200px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  /*Initially hidden because it's outside the initial card height */\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease;\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-text {\n  height: auto; /*Revealed on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some hidden text that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  The card uses only CSS for the animation and expansion.  This demonstrates smooth transitions and subtle visual feedback to create a more engaging user experience.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is key to the animation. It specifies that the `background-color` and `height` properties should transition smoothly over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease\" timing function.\n* **`height` property:**  The initial height of the card is set, and the `:hover` pseudo-class increases the height, revealing the hidden content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the content from overflowing the card before the expansion.\n* **`flex-direction: column;`:**  This arranges the title and text vertically within the card.\n* **`.card-text` height and transition:** This styles the text content. It's initially hidden and uses a transition to smoothly change its height.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) (While not directly used here, understanding transforms is beneficial for more complex animations)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** (Search for \"CSS animations\" or \"CSS transitions\" on this website for numerous tutorials and examples) [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
