[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware to perform redirects based on the incoming request's URL. Specifically, we'll focus on scenarios where attempting to access `request.nextUrl.pathname` within the middleware leads to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when dealing with dynamic routes.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error typically manifests as a runtime error or unexpected redirect behavior.  It often happens when the middleware attempts to manipulate or access `request.nextUrl.pathname` before the request's URL has been fully processed, particularly within dynamic routes involving segments.  Attempting to directly use the `request.nextUrl.pathname` might not reflect the actual pathname, especially when dealing with rewrite rules that haven't been fully applied.  This can lead to incorrect redirects or unexpected page rendering.\n\n**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we want to redirect all requests to `/blog/[slug]` to `/blog` if the slug is empty or not provided:\n\n**Problematic Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl;\n\n  if (pathname.startsWith('/blog/') && pathname.split('/')[2] === '') {\n      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/blog', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/blog/:slug*',\n}\n```\n\nThis code is flawed because `pathname` might not yet accurately reflect the post-rewrite URL.  The `pathname.split('/')[2]` approach is also fragile and error-prone.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl;\n\n  // More robust check for empty slug\n  if (pathname.startsWith('/blog/') && pathname === '/blog/') {\n      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/blog', req.url))\n  }\n\n  // Alternatively, handle dynamic segments directly within the matcher.\n  // This approach is generally preferred for cleaner code and better performance.\n}\n\n\nexport const config = {\n    matcher: [\n        '/blog/:slug*', // Match blog routes with or without slug\n    ],\n}\n```\n\nThis improved code handles the empty slug scenario more reliably.  The condition checks if the pathname is exactly `/blog/`.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe original code's primary issue was relying on `request.nextUrl.pathname` prematurely.  The updated version checks directly for the specific path `/blog/`, avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable intermediate path segment extraction. Using the `matcher` config provides more control and avoids potentially error-prone attempts to manipulate the URL within the `middleware` function itself.  The improved method offers a more robust, accurate, and maintainable approach for handling this type of redirect.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js URL Object](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#url)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
