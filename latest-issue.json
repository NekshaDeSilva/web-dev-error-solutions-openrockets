[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using the `next/font` package within Next.js Middleware. Specifically, we'll focus on the error that occurs when attempting to use fonts loaded with `next/font` within middleware functions that need to generate responses based on font information.  The core issue stems from the fact that `next/font`'s font loading process is asynchronous and might not be fully completed by the time the middleware function needs to send a response.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error isn't always a clear-cut error message. Instead, you might experience unexpected behavior such as:\n\n* **Incorrect font rendering:** The expected font doesn't appear in the generated HTML, resulting in a fallback font being used instead.\n* **Middleware function timing issues:** The middleware function might return a response before the font loading is complete, leading to inconsistent behavior or errors.\n* **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'family')` or similar:**  This error happens when the code tries to access font properties from `next/font` before the font object is fully initialized.\n\n**Code Example & Step-by-step Fix:**\n\nLet's say we have a middleware function that aims to modify the HTML response based on the user's detected font preference. The initial, flawed approach might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('X-Font', inter.style.fontFamily); // ERROR PRONE!\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\nThis code attempts to access `inter.style.fontFamily` directly. However, `inter` is an asynchronous object that might not be fully populated when this line is executed.\n\nHere's the corrected code, using `async/await` to ensure the font is fully loaded before accessing its properties:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\n\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  await inter.load(); // Await the font loading\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('X-Font', inter.style.fontFamily);\n  return response;\n}\n\n```\n\nThis fix uses `await inter.load();` to ensure that the font loading process completes before accessing the `inter.style.fontFamily` property.  This eliminates the race condition that leads to the error.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `next/font` package uses asynchronous operations to load fonts.  If you directly access font properties before the loading is finished, you'll run into the problems described earlier. Using `async/await` ensures that the code waits for the font to load completely before proceeding, resolving the timing issue and preventing undefined property accesses.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Font Optimization Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/font-optimization) –  Provides general information on font optimization in Next.js.\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) – Explains the usage and constraints of API Routes in Next.js.\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware) – Describes how to use and implement Next.js Middleware.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy understanding the asynchronous nature of `next/font` and employing `async/await`, you can prevent common issues when using fonts within Next.js Middleware.  Remember to always handle asynchronous operations properly to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
