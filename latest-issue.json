[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only technique to create an expanding card effect, providing a smooth transition when a card is hovered over.  This effect enhances user interaction and provides a visually appealing way to present information. We'll be using pure CSS3 for this, avoiding the need for JavaScript.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to create the expansion effect.  On hover, the card's height and width expand, creating a visual \"reveal\" of further content.  We'll also use a subtle box-shadow to add depth and improve the visual appeal.  The primary styling is achieved with CSS transitions applied to `transform` and `box-shadow` properties.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during expansion */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  text-align: center;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample content within the expanding card.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the base card.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from spilling outside the card during expansion. `transition` property defines the smooth animation for `transform` and `box-shadow`.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles when the card is hovered over. `transform: scale(1.1);` increases the size by 10%, creating the expansion effect.  The `box-shadow` is increased to enhance the visual feedback.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better presentation.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
