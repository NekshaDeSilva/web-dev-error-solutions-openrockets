[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create a triangle using only CSS.  This is a classic CSS trick that demonstrates the power of CSS borders to create shapes beyond simple rectangles and squares. We will achieve this using a single HTML element and some clever CSS styling.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nWe'll leverage the `border` property of CSS. By setting different border widths and colors, and cleverly using transparency (`transparent`), we can create the illusion of a triangle.  One border will form the triangle's hypotenuse, while the other two will be invisible.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CSS Triangle</title>\n<style>\n.triangle {\n  width: 0;\n  height: 0;\n  border-left: 50px solid transparent; /* Left border, invisible */\n  border-right: 50px solid transparent; /* Right border, invisible */\n  border-bottom: 100px solid blue; /* Bottom border, forms the base */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"triangle\"></div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`width: 0; height: 0;`**:  This sets the initial dimensions of the div to zero. This is crucial; otherwise, the borders wouldn't form a triangle.\n* **`border-left: 50px solid transparent;`**: This creates a transparent left border of 50 pixels.  It's invisible but contributes to the shape.\n* **`border-right: 50px solid transparent;`**: This creates a transparent right border of 50 pixels, also invisible but forming part of the triangle's shape.\n* **`border-bottom: 100px solid blue;`**: This creates a blue solid border of 100 pixels at the bottom. This acts as the base of our triangle.\n\nThe combination of these transparent and colored borders creates the visual effect of a triangle.  You can adjust the border widths and colors to change the size and appearance of the triangle. For example, changing `50px` and `100px` will change the proportions, and changing `blue` will change the fill color.\n\n\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Borders:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)  This provides a comprehensive reference for the `border` property.\n* **CSS-Tricks:** Search for \"CSS triangles\" on [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)  CSS-Tricks often features articles on creative CSS techniques.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
