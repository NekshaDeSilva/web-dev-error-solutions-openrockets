[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Request Not Found` error. This error typically occurs when middleware attempts to access a route that doesn't exist, leading to a failed request.  It's particularly problematic because it can be difficult to debug, especially when middleware is involved in complex routing scenarios.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Request Not Found` error in Next.js middleware manifests as a 404 error in the browser or a similar error in your logs. It indicates that the middleware function tried to access a route (often implicitly through `next.nextUrl.pathname`) that wasn't found by the Next.js router.  This often happens because of typos in the path, incorrect usage of wildcards (`*`), or issues with the overall routing configuration of your application.  The error message itself may not always be very specific, making debugging challenging.\n\n## Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Code Example\n\nLet's assume you have middleware that attempts to redirect users based on a path, but contains a typo:\n\n**Problematic Middleware (`middleware.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  if (url.pathname === '/profle') { // Typo: 'profle' instead of 'profile'\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/profle', '/profile', '/login'], // Note: This incorrectly includes 'profle'\n}\n```\n\nThis code will cause a `Request Not Found` error if a user attempts to access `/profle`.\n\n**Corrected Middleware (`middleware.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  if (url.pathname === '/profile') {  // Corrected typo\n    const isLoggedIn = checkIfLoggedIn(req); // Placeholder for authentication check\n    if (!isLoggedIn) {\n      url.pathname = '/login';\n      return NextResponse.redirect(url); // Use redirect for better UX\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Placeholder for authentication logic\nfunction checkIfLoggedIn(req) {\n    // Add your authentication logic here, e.g., checking for a session cookie.\n    return false; // Example: Not logged in initially\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/profile', '/login'], // Removed incorrect path\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version fixes the typo in the pathname and removes the incorrect entry from the `matcher` array.  It also demonstrates best practice by using `NextResponse.redirect()` instead of `NextResponse.rewrite()`, leading to a better user experience.  A placeholder for authentication logic is included to demonstrate a more realistic scenario.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `Request Not Found` error is solved by carefully examining the paths used in the middleware's `matcher` and the path comparisons within the middleware function itself.  Double-check for typos, ensure the wildcard character (`*`) is used correctly if necessary, and make sure the paths match the actual routes in your application.  Using `console.log(req.nextUrl.pathname)` within your middleware can be helpful for debugging path issues. Additionally, using  `NextResponse.redirect()` for user-facing redirects is generally preferred over `NextResponse.rewrite()`.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  This provides comprehensive information on configuring and using middleware.\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) (Useful for context, even if not directly related to the error)\n* **NextResponse Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse) (For understanding the differences between `rewrite` and `redirect`)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
