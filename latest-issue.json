[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The card expands vertically to reveal more content when hovered over, creating a smooth and engaging user experience. This example uses pure CSS, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to achieve the expanding effect.  Initially, the card's height is set to a minimum, revealing only a summary.  On hover, the height transitions smoothly to its maximum, displaying the full content.  A subtle background shadow is added to enhance visual appeal.  The overall style is clean and modern.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content.  You can add more text here to see the expansion effect in action.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from spilling outside the card during the expansion.  The `transition` property defines the animation for the height change.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles specifically when the mouse hovers over the card, increasing its height.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and structure.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (Search for \"CSS transitions\" or \"hover effects\")\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
