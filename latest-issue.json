[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11): failure to render charts correctly or rendering blank spaces.  This is often due to IE11's limited support for certain HTML5 canvas features used by CanvasJS.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nIn IE11, you might encounter situations where a CanvasJS chart either doesn't render at all, displays a blank space where the chart should be, or renders incompletely with missing elements.  This is not a CanvasJS bug per se, but rather a compatibility issue with the older browser.  The browser's console may not always provide helpful error messages.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe most reliable solution involves using a polyfill, specifically one that addresses the `excanvas` compatibility issue sometimes found in older IE versions.  While CanvasJS itself attempts some level of compatibility, a direct polyfill is often necessary.  We'll use the `excanvas` library here (though other compatibility libraries might also work).\n\n**1. Include the excanvas library:**\n\nFirst, download the `excanvas.js` file (easily found with a web search, look for reputable sources).  Place this file in your project's JavaScript directory.  Then, include it in your HTML file *before* including the CanvasJS script:\n\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<script src=\"excanvas.js\"></script>  <!-- Include excanvas BEFORE CanvasJS -->\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script> </head>\n<body>\n\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        title:{\n            text: \"Basic Column Chart\"\n        },\n        data: [\n        {\n            type: \"column\",\n            dataPoints: [\n                { label: \"Apple\",  y: 10  },\n                { label: \"Orange\", y: 15  },\n                { label: \"Banana\", y: 25  }\n            ]\n        }\n        ]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**2. Verify CanvasJS Inclusion:**\n\nMake absolutely sure you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your project. Double-check the path and the file name (`canvasjs.min.js` or the unminified version).\n\n**3. Test in IE11:**\n\nOpen your webpage in IE11 and verify that the chart renders correctly.  If not, inspect the browser's developer tools console for any additional error messages that might offer further clues.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n`excanvas.js` provides a compatibility layer for older browsers that lack full support for the HTML5 canvas element.  By including it *before* the CanvasJS library, we ensure that CanvasJS has access to the necessary functionality to render the chart even in IE11's less-capable rendering engine.  The order of inclusion is critical.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)  (Check their documentation for browser compatibility details, although it might not explicitly mention the need for excanvas in all cases)\n* **Excanvas (Search for this term):**  You will find several repositories and downloads for excanvas.js.  Choose a reliable source.  Note that this is an older library and might not be actively maintained.  Modern browsers generally don't require it.\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
