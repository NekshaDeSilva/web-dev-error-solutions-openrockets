[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using Next.js Middleware with dynamic routes and redirects.  The issue arises when attempting to redirect based on dynamic route segments which are not properly accessed within the Middleware function.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, failing redirects, or even runtime errors.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nYou might encounter this problem if your middleware attempts to redirect based on a dynamic route parameter (`[id]`, `[slug]`, etc.) but the `req.nextUrl.pathname` doesn't correctly reflect the dynamic segment.  Instead of redirecting as expected based on the dynamic path, the redirect might fail or redirect to an unintended location.  This usually manifests as the user being stuck on the initial page, receiving an unexpected redirect, or encountering a 500 Internal Server Error.\n\n\n**Code Example and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's assume we have a blog with dynamic posts using `pages/blog/[slug].js`. We want middleware to redirect any requests to `/blog/old-post` to `/blog/updated-post`.  The naive, and incorrect, approach might look like this:\n\n\n**Incorrect Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/blog/old-post') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/blog/updated-post', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/blog/:path*',\n}\n```\n\nThis code fails because the `req.nextUrl.pathname` in the middleware always reflects the incoming request path before any dynamic routing is processed by Next.js.  Therefore, it won't correctly match the dynamic `[slug]` segment.\n\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nTo fix this, we need to access the dynamic segment from `req.nextUrl.pathname` and compare it correctly.  Then we can perform the conditional redirect.\n\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl;\n  const slug = pathname.split('/').pop(); // Extract slug\n\n  if (slug === 'old-post') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/blog/updated-post', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/blog/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code extracts the `slug` from the `pathname` by splitting the path and taking the last element. Now, the comparison correctly checks if the dynamic segment matches 'old-post'. This will guarantee the expected redirect behavior, ensuring your users reach the intended page.  The `matcher` in the `config` object ensures the middleware only applies to paths under `/blog`.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) -  The official documentation for Next.js Middleware.\n* [Next.js Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing) - General documentation on Next.js routing.\n* [NextResponse Object](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse) -  Details on the `NextResponse` object.\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
