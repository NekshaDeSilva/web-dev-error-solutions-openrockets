[{"body":"\nThis challenge focuses on building a visually appealing card element that gives the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality using only CSS. We'll achieve this effect using shadows, gradients, and subtle transformations.  No JavaScript is required!\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will feature:\n\n* A slightly elevated appearance through box-shadow.\n* A subtle gradient to add depth and visual interest.\n* Rounded corners for a softer look.\n* A light inner shadow to further enhance the 3D effect.\n* A title and content area within the card.\n\n\n## Full Code (CSS only)\n\n```css\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  background-color: #f4f4f4;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /*Outer shadow*/\n  padding: 20px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing the rounded corners */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffffff, #f0f0f0); /* Subtle gradient */\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  padding: 10px;\n  box-shadow: inset -2px -2px 5px rgba(255,255,255,0.5); /*Inner shadow*/\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  line-height: 1.6;\n}\n\n\n```\n\nYou would then include this CSS in your HTML file within a `<style>` tag or a linked stylesheet.  Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">My 3D Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some sample text for the card content.  You can add as much text as you like.  The styling will ensure it remains readable and visually appealing within the card's boundaries.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`box-shadow`**: This property creates the shadow effect. The first two values are the horizontal and vertical offsets, the third is the blur radius, and the fourth is the color and opacity.  Experiment with these values to fine-tune the shadow.\n* **`linear-gradient`**:  This creates a subtle gradient to give the card more visual depth.\n* **`inset` in `box-shadow`**: The `inset` keyword creates an inner shadow, further enhancing the 3D effect.\n* **`border-radius`**:  This rounds the corners of both the card and its inner content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the card's content from overflowing the rounded corners.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Box Shadow):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n* **MDN Web Docs (CSS Gradients):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)\n* **CSS-Tricks (Box Shadow Tutorials):** Search \"box shadow tutorial\" on css-tricks.com for various advanced techniques.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
