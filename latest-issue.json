[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Request Not Found` error.  This error typically arises when middleware attempts to access a path that doesn't exist or isn't handled by your application.  It can be frustrating because it often lacks specific details, making debugging challenging.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Request Not Found` error in Next.js Middleware manifests as a 404 error in your browser or API client.  It means the middleware function was triggered by a request, but Next.js couldn't find a matching route or page to handle that request after the middleware has executed.  This can be confusing because your middleware might seem to be working correctly, but the underlying request still fails to find its destination.\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's assume we have middleware that redirects requests based on a cookie:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const cookie = req.cookies.get('auth');\n  if (!cookie) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/profile', '/dashboard/:id'],\n};\n```\n\nIf a user directly accesses `/profile` or `/dashboard/123` without the necessary cookie, the middleware will redirect them to `/login`. However, if the `/login` page itself is missing, or there's a typo in the redirect URL, we will get a `Request Not Found` error.\n\n\n**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Verify the Target URL:** Double-check that the URL specified in `NextResponse.redirect` is correct and points to an existing page or API route. In our example, ensure a `/login` page exists ( `pages/login.js` or `pages/login.tsx`).\n\n2. **Check for Typos:** Carefully review your redirect URLs for typos. Even a small mistake can cause a `Request Not Found` error.  Case sensitivity is crucial.\n\n3. **Ensure the Route Exists:** Make sure the route specified in the `matcher` configuration of your middleware actually exists in your Next.js application.\n\n4. **Review Middleware Logic:** Ensure your middleware logic handles all possible scenarios.  If there's a possibility of conditions not being met, provide a fallback:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // pages/api/middleware.js\n   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\n   export function middleware(req) {\n     const cookie = req.cookies.get('auth');\n     if (!cookie) {\n       return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n     }\n     // Added fallback if route specified doesn't exist.\n     return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/home', req.url));\n   }\n\n   export const config = {\n     matcher: ['/profile', '/dashboard/:id'],\n   };\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `NextResponse.rewrite` Carefully:**  `NextResponse.rewrite` will change the request URL, while `NextResponse.redirect` will cause a full HTTP redirect. Choose the appropriate one depending on your needs.  Incorrect usage may also lead to `Request Not Found` issues.\n\n6. **Test Thoroughly:** After making changes, thoroughly test your middleware with various scenarios and requests to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `Request Not Found` error in Next.js Middleware stems from a disconnect between what your middleware intends to do and what the actual routing system can fulfill.  If the middleware redirects or rewrites to a non-existent path, Next.js will respond with a 404.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
