[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware:  `Error: Next.js middleware response must not contain a 'Set-Cookie' header`.  This error arises when attempting to set cookies directly within your middleware function.  Middleware is intended for modifying requests before they reach the page or API route, not for directly managing the response's cookies.  Cookie management should be handled within the API route or page itself.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error message `Error: Next.js middleware response must not contain a 'Set-Cookie' header` clearly states that you cannot set cookies directly in the response object returned by your middleware function.  This is a design constraint to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the middleware layer.  Attempting to do so results in this error, halting the request processing.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you have a middleware function attempting to set a cookie:\n\n\n**Incorrect Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'myCookie=myValue; Path=/; HttpOnly'); // INCORRECT!\n  // ... rest of your middleware logic ...\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected']\n}\n```\n\nThis code will produce the error.  To fix it, we need to move the cookie setting to an API route.\n\n**Correct Implementation using API Route:**\n\n1. **Create an API Route:** Create a new API route (e.g., `/api/set-cookie`) to handle the cookie setting.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/set-cookie.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', 'myCookie=myValue; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict');\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Cookie set successfully' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n2. **Redirect from Middleware:** Modify your middleware to redirect to the API route which sets the cookie.  This ensures the cookie is set correctly *after* the middleware has performed its other tasks.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/protected')) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/api/set-cookie', req.url))\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected']\n}\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n```\n\n3. **Protected Route:**  The protected route will now only be accessible after the cookie is set by the API route:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/protected.js\nimport { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';\n\nexport default function ProtectedPage() {\n  const [cookies] = useCookies(['myCookie']);\n\n  if (!cookies.myCookie) {\n    return <p>Please log in.</p>;\n  }\n\n  return <p>Welcome to the protected page!</p>;\n}\n```\n\n\n**Note:** Remember to install `react-cookie`: `npm install react-cookie`\n\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core reason behind this limitation is that Next.js middleware operates at a very early stage of the request lifecycle.  Setting cookies in the middleware response would disrupt the intended workflow.  The redirect mechanism ensures that the cookie is set correctly within the context of an API route, which is designed for such operations.  The API route then handles the response and cookie management correctly without conflicting with the middleware's primary purpose.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
