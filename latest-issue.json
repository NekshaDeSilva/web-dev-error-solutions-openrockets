[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with Next.js Middleware, specifically when accessing properties from the `request` object before they've been properly populated. This often manifests when trying to access localization data (like `locale`) within the middleware function before the relevant headers are fully processed.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error message `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')` indicates that you're attempting to access the `locale` property of the `request` object within your middleware, but this property is `undefined`.  This usually occurs because the middleware function is executed before Next.js has had a chance to parse and set the request headers containing the locale information.\n\n\n## Code Example: Problematic Middleware\n\nThis code attempts to redirect based on locale *before* the locale is available:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale; // Error occurs here!\n\n  if (locale === 'es') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n};\n```\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix\n\n\n1. **Ensure Locale Parsing:** Confirm that your Next.js application is correctly configured to parse locales. Check your `next.config.js` file for the `i18n` configuration.  Without this, the locale will never be available.\n\n```javascript\n// next.config.js\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'es'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n2. **Asynchronous Middleware:** The problem arises because the request headers are not immediately available.  Rewrite your middleware to use an async function and `await` the request headers processing implicitly by using `req.nextUrl.locale`.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale; // Now it should work\n\n  if (locale === 'es') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url));\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n};\n```\n\n3. **Conditional Logic (Alternative):** If you need to perform actions based on the locale *only* for specific routes or conditions, you can add conditional logic after explicitly checking if `locale` is defined:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  const locale = req.nextUrl.locale;\n\n  if (locale && locale === 'es') { //Check for undefined\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url));\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n};\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe original code attempts to access `req.nextUrl.locale` synchronously.  However, Next.js's internal processing of the request, including parsing locale information from headers, happens asynchronously. By using `async/await`, we ensure that the middleware waits for the `req.nextUrl.locale` property to be populated before accessing it, resolving the error.  The conditional check in the alternative method provides robustness against the edge case where the locale is not found.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js Internationalization (i18n) Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/i18n-routing)\n* [Next.js `next/server` API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/file-system-routing)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
