[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating Video.js into responsive web designs: the player's height not adjusting correctly to maintain aspect ratio when the browser window is resized.  This leads to distorted video playback or unnecessary letterboxing/pillarboxing.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe Video.js player, by default, might not automatically resize its height to match the aspect ratio of the video when the browser window is resized. This often results in a stretched or squished video appearance, ruining the viewing experience.  The player might retain its initial height, ignoring changes in the container's dimensions.  This is particularly problematic on smaller screens or when using responsive design techniques.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis solution uses CSS and JavaScript to ensure the Video.js player maintains its aspect ratio dynamically.\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Responsive Video.js Player</title>\n<link href=\"https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<style>\n  .video-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n  }\n  .video-js {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\" data-setup=\"{}\">\n    <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    <source src=\"myvideo.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n    <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a></p>\n  </video>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  //Optional: Initialize Video.js (if needed)\n  var player = videojs('my-video');\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation of HTML:**\n\n*   The `.video-container` div uses padding-bottom to create the aspect ratio. The percentage (56.25% in this example, for a 16:9 aspect ratio) is calculated as `(height / width) * 100%`. Adjust this value if you have a different aspect ratio.  This is crucial for maintaining aspect ratio on resize.\n*   The `video` element is placed within the container, and the CSS positions it absolutely to fill the container.\n\n\n**2.  JavaScript (Optional but recommended for advanced features):**\n\nWhile the CSS solution above is often sufficient, you might need JavaScript for more complex scenarios, especially if you're dynamically changing the video source or other player options.  Video.js itself handles responsive resizing fairly well if the container is correctly structured.\n\n\n## External References\n\n*   **Video.js Documentation:** [https://docs.videojs.com/](https://docs.videojs.com/)  (Check their responsive design guides)\n*   **Responsive Design Techniques:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_auto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_auto) (Understanding `padding-bottom` and aspect ratio calculations)\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to use CSS to maintain the aspect ratio of the video container.  By setting the `padding-bottom` percentage on the container, we create a fixed aspect ratio, regardless of the container's width.  When the browser window is resized, the container's width adjusts, and the `padding-bottom` ensures that the height is adjusted proportionally, preventing distortion. This method effectively couples the height to the width, keeping the aspect ratio constant. The Video.js player, being positioned absolutely within this container, then automatically adapts to its size.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
