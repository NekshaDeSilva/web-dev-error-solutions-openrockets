[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: importing modules that are not compatible with the `next/server` runtime environment. Middleware functions run on the server *before* a request reaches the application, operating within a constrained context.  Attempting to import client-side modules, or modules that rely on browser APIs, will result in runtime errors.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe most frequent manifestation of this problem is a runtime error similar to:\n\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'moduleName' imported from /path/to/middleware.js\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nError: Dynamic import() is not supported in this environment\n```\n\n\nThis indicates that your middleware file is attempting to import a module that's not available or compatible in the server-side environment provided by `next/server`.  This often happens when inadvertently importing client-side libraries like `react`, `react-dom`, or browser-specific APIs (e.g., `window`, `document`).\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you're building middleware to redirect users based on a cookie.  The following incorrect code would throw an error:\n\n**Incorrect Middleware (`middleware.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Client-side library!\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const cookieValue = Cookies.get('userLoggedIn');\n  if (!cookieValue) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n```\n\nThis code fails because `js-cookie` is a client-side library. Here's the corrected version:\n\n**Corrected Middleware (`middleware.js`):**\n\n```javascript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n// Removing js-cookie import\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const cookieValue = req.cookies.get('userLoggedIn'); // Use req.cookies\n\n  if (!cookieValue) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe core change is replacing the client-side `js-cookie` library with the built-in `req.cookies` object provided by Next.js within the middleware context.  `req.cookies` provides server-side access to cookies without needing an external dependency designed for the browser. This avoids the import error.  Remember to always consider the environment (server-side for middleware) when selecting modules.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - Official documentation for Next.js Middleware, crucial for understanding its limitations and capabilities.\n* [Next.js Request Object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/request-object) - Details about the `req` object and its properties, including `req.cookies`.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Dependencies:** Carefully examine all imports in your middleware files.  Ensure each module is compatible with the server-side environment.\n* **Client-Side Logic:** Avoid client-side specific logic in Middleware.  It's meant for server-side operations before the request reaches the client.\n* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and gracefully manage potential issues.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
