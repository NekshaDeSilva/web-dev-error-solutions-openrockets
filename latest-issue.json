[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js API routes: the `ERR_INVALID_CHUNK_ENCODING` error, often triggered by attempting to send very large responses from an API route.  This usually manifests in the browser as a network error, and the response never reaches the client.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `ERR_INVALID_CHUNK_ENCODING` error typically arises when a large response from your Next.js API route is improperly chunked or exceeds the browser's capacity to handle a single request.  This is particularly problematic with files, images, or large datasets.  The browser struggles to process the incomplete or incorrectly formatted chunks of data it receives.\n\n\n**Code and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's assume we have an API route (`pages/api/largedata.js`) that attempts to send a large JSON file:\n\n**Problematic Code (pages/api/largedata.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/largedata.js\nimport largeData from '../../data/largedata.json';\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json(largeData); \n}\n```\n\nThis code might work for small datasets, but fails for large `largedata.json`.  The fix involves streaming the response instead of sending the entire JSON at once.  We'll use the `ReadableStream` from the Node.js `stream` module.\n\n**Corrected Code (pages/api/largedata.js):**\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/largedata.js\nimport { pipeline } from 'stream/promises';\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport { Readable } from 'stream';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const filePath = '../../data/largedata.json';\n\n  try {\n      const readStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);\n      res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });\n      await pipeline(readStream, res);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error streaming data:\", error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to send data' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Import necessary modules:** We import `pipeline` for efficient stream handling, `fs` for file system access, and `Readable` (though not directly used in this example, it is useful to know for more complex scenarios.)\n2. **Create Readable Stream:** `fs.createReadStream(filePath)` creates a readable stream from the JSON file. This allows data to be sent in smaller chunks.\n3. **Set Response Headers:** `res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })` sets the appropriate HTTP status code and content type.  This is crucial for the client to correctly interpret the response.\n4. **Use pipeline:** `await pipeline(readStream, res)` pipes the data from the readable stream to the response.  This handles the chunking efficiently and avoids memory issues. The `await` keyword ensures that the entire pipeline completes before the function returns.\n5. **Error Handling:**  The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during file reading or streaming, preventing the server from crashing and providing a more graceful response to the client.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Node.js Stream Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Working with large files in Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/working-with-large-files-in-nodejs/) (A more general article on handling large files in Node.js, which might be helpful if you're dealing with other file types)\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
