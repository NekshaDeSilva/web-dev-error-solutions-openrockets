[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the \"headers already sent\" error. This error typically occurs when you try to send a response multiple times within a middleware function, often due to unintended side effects or incorrect usage of response modification methods.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe \"headers already sent\" error in Next.js Middleware manifests when the server attempts to send HTTP headers (like status codes, content types, etc.) after it has already initiated the response. This is a fatal error that prevents the server from correctly processing the request and results in an unhandled exception, disrupting the application's functionality.  The exact error message might vary slightly depending on the server environment, but the core issue is always the same: a double (or more) attempt to send a response.\n\n\n## Code Example and Fix: Incorrect Middleware Function\n\nLet's consider an example of a faulty middleware function that triggers the error:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Middleware!' }); // First response\n    console.log(\"Something happens after response sent\")\n    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'test'); // Attempting to send headers after first response\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about'],\n}\n```\n\nThis code is flawed because it attempts to send the headers (`res.setHeader`) *after* already sending a full response (`res.status(200).json`). This causes the \"headers already sent\" error.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix\n\nTo resolve the issue, ensure you send the headers and the response body in a single operation.  We'll modify the middleware function to correct this:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'test');\n    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Middleware!' }); //Headers and Response sent together.\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about'],\n}\n```\n\nNow, both the header and the response body are sent as a single, unified operation, preventing the \"headers already sent\" error.  The order matters; set headers *before* calling `res.json()`, `res.send()`, or other methods that send the response body.\n\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core reason for this error is the underlying HTTP protocol.  Once the HTTP response headers are sent, the server implicitly signals the beginning of the response body.  Any attempt to modify headers (or even the status code) after this point violates the protocol and triggers the error.  Next.js Middleware functions need to be carefully designed to prevent this scenario.  Avoid sending partial responses or attempting to modify the response after the initial response has been initiated.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) -  This is the official documentation for Next.js Middleware, providing thorough information about its functionalities and usage.\n* [Node.js HTTP Response Object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpresponse) - Understanding how Node.js handles HTTP responses helps to grasp the underlying reason for the \"headers already sent\" error.
