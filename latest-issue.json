[{"body":"\n**Description:**\n\nWe're experiencing excessive re-renders in our component, specifically within a `useEffect` hook.  The problem seems to stem from the way we're managing the dependency array. We're passing an object as a dependency, and React isn't effectively detecting when the object has truly *changed*.  This leads to unnecessary calls to the effect, impacting performance and potentially causing unexpected side effects.\n\n\n**Example Code:**\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    console.log('useEffect called!');\n    // Perform some expensive operation with data\n  }, [data]); // Problem: Object comparison issue\n\n  const updateData = () => {\n    setData({ ...data, age: data.age + 1 }); // Seems like a shallow copy, but still triggers re-render\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Name: {data.name}</p>\n      <p>Age: {data.age}</p>\n      <button onClick={updateData}>Update Age</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe `useEffect` hook should only run when the `data` object's properties actually change.  In the example above, clicking the button should update the age, and the effect should run accordingly.  However, even a seemingly shallow copy triggers a re-render, as React's default object comparison is shallow.\n\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is triggered even when only a single property within the `data` object changes.  This leads to performance degradation, especially with complex objects or computationally intensive operations within the effect.\n\n\n**Possible Solutions (or questions):**\n\n* Using `useMemo` to memoize the object and only trigger a re-render when the object reference changes (but this might lead to other issues with stale closures).\n* Using a custom equality check function within the `useEffect` dependency array.\n* Refactoring the state management to utilize simpler data structures, or using a state management library (Redux, Zustand, Jotai)\n\nWe're seeking advice on the best approach to resolve this common issue and optimize our component's performance.  Any suggestions or examples are greatly appreciated.\n","number":51,"title":"## Issue: Unexpected re-renders due to object comparison in useEffect dependency array"}]
