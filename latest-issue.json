[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart visualization.  The error typically manifests as the VideoJS player failing to initialize or render properly, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be. This is frequently caused by conflicts in JavaScript libraries or incorrect DOM manipulation.  We'll address a scenario where the VideoJS player's initialization is delayed due to the CanvasJS chart rendering asynchronously.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe VideoJS player fails to render, showing a blank area where the player should appear.  Browser console might show no errors, or possibly generic errors related to DOM element access or script loading conflicts.  This happens when `videojs()` is called before the DOM element it targets is fully rendered.  The CanvasJS chart might be asynchronously loading and rendering its elements, delaying the availability of the VideoJS container element.\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// CanvasJS chart setup (async rendering)\nvar chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...\n});\nchart.render();\n\n// VideoJS player setup (too early!)\nvar player = videojs('myVideoPlayer', {\n  // ... your VideoJS options ...\n});\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThis solution ensures VideoJS initialization only occurs after the CanvasJS chart has completely rendered. We'll use CanvasJS's `render` event:\n\n```javascript\n// CanvasJS chart setup (with render event handler)\nvar chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n  // ... your CanvasJS chart configuration ...\n});\n\nchart.render();\n\nchart.options.animationEnabled = true; //Ensure animation is enabled\n\nchart.on(\"dataAnimationEnd\", function(){ //Adding event listner after data animation completes \n    // VideoJS player setup (now safe to initialize)\n    var player = videojs('myVideoPlayer', {\n      sources: [{ src: 'your-video.mp4', type: 'video/mp4' }],\n      autoplay: false,\n      controls: true,\n      // ... other VideoJS options ...\n    });\n  });\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key change is using the `dataAnimationEnd` event of the CanvasJS chart.  This event fires only after the chart's animation is fully complete and all elements are rendered in the DOM. By placing the `videojs()` initialization call within the `dataAnimationEnd` event handler, we guarantee that the required DOM element (`myVideoPlayer`) exists and is ready for VideoJS to use it.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)  (Check for API documentation on events)\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/) (Check for initialization best practices)\n* **JavaScript Asynchronous Programming:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) (Understanding asynchronous operations)\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n- Ensure your HTML includes the correct `<video>` element with the ID \"myVideoPlayer\" within the `chartContainer` div or a parent container.\n- Verify the paths to your VideoJS and CanvasJS libraries are correct.\n- Check the browser's developer console for any additional errors that might be occurring.\n- Consider using a promise or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of the chart rendering if preferred instead of the chart event.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
