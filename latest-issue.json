[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: rate limits.  Discord implements rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of its platform.  Exceeding these limits results in errors, often leading to your bot ceasing functionality temporarily or permanently.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen your bot sends messages, edits messages, creates reactions, or performs other actions too frequently, Discord will respond with a rate limit error.  This typically manifests as a `DiscordAPIError` with a `HTTP` code of `429` (Too Many Requests). The error message will often include details about the rate limit bucket that was exceeded, including the remaining requests and the reset time.\n\n**Full Code of Fixing Step-by-Step:**\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle rate limits using `async`/`await` and a simple retry mechanism.  More sophisticated solutions might involve using a dedicated rate limit handling library.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\n// Function to send a message with rate limit handling\nasync function sendMessageWithRetry(channel, message, retries = 3) {\n  try {\n    await channel.send(message);\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.code === 50035) { //Missing Access\n        console.error(\"Missing Access to send message\");\n        return;\n    }\n    if (error.httpStatus === 429) {\n      const retryAfter = error.retryAfter || 1000; // Default retry after 1 second if not specified\n      console.warn(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryAfter / 1000} seconds...`);\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter));\n      if (retries > 0) {\n        return sendMessageWithRetry(channel, message, retries - 1);\n      } else {\n        console.error(`Failed to send message after multiple retries: ${error}`);\n      }\n    } else {\n      console.error(`Error sending message: ${error}`);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async (msg) => {\n    if (msg.content.toLowerCase() === \"!test\"){\n        const channel = msg.channel;\n        await sendMessageWithRetry(channel, \"This message handles rate limits!\");\n    }\n\n});\n\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace with your bot token\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`sendMessageWithRetry` function:** This function encapsulates the message sending logic and retry mechanism.\n2. **Error Handling:**  It catches the `DiscordAPIError` and checks for the `httpStatus` code 429.\n3. **Retry Logic:** If a 429 error occurs, it waits for the specified `retryAfter` time (in milliseconds) before attempting to send the message again.  It recursively calls itself with a decremented retry count.\n4. **Fallback:** If all retries fail, it logs an error message.\n5. **Integration:** The `messageCreate` event listener uses the `sendMessageWithRetry` function to handle potential rate limits when sending messages.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Discord.js Documentation:** [https://discord.js.org/](https://discord.js.org/)  (Check for API updates and best practices)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:**  (Unfortunately, Discord doesn't have a single, comprehensive page detailing *all* rate limits.  You'll need to observe and adapt to the limits encountered.)\n\n\n**Note:** This example provides a basic retry mechanism. For production bots, you should implement a more robust solution that manages rate limits per route and bucket, potentially using a library specifically designed for rate limiting.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
