[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing animation.  We'll leverage standard CSS properties, making this accessible and understandable even for beginners.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a compact state. On hover, it expands smoothly to reveal more content.  The expansion is achieved by increasing the height of the card and subtly altering the opacity of the content within.  A subtle box-shadow is added to give depth.  The styling is kept simple and clean to focus on the core animation.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 250px; /* Expanded height */\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth opacity transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Ensure content is fully visible on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is a simple example of an expanding card created using only CSS.  No JavaScript is needed! Hover over the card to see the animation.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is key to the animation.  It specifies which properties (`height`, `box-shadow`) should transition smoothly over 0.3 seconds using an `ease-in-out` timing function.\n* **`height` property:**  The initial and expanded heights of the card are defined. The transition makes the change smooth.\n* **`box-shadow` property:**  This adds depth to the card and is also transitioned for a more refined effect.\n* **`opacity` property:** The opacity transition ensures the content fades in smoothly as the card expands.\n* **`hover` pseudo-class:**  The styles within the `:hover` selector only apply when the mouse hovers over the card.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
