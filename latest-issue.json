[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required.  The effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll utilize CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to achieve this.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is structured using a combination of divs. The main container holds the card's content, and the expanding section is contained within a child div. The CSS utilizes `max-height` and transitions to smoothly animate the height change on hover.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-expand {\n  max-height: 0; /* Initially collapsed */\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-expand {\n  max-height: 200px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some introductory text for the card.  It demonstrates a simple expanding card effect created using only CSS.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card-expand\">\n    <p>This is the additional content that expands when you hover over the card.  You can add as much content as you want here.</p>\n    <p>This extra content adds more visual interest and demonstrates the expanding nature of the card.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card, including background color, border radius, and a crucial `overflow: hidden;` to prevent the expanded content from overflowing before the transition.  The `transition` property ensures a smooth animation.\n* **`.card-content`:**  This styles the initial, always visible content of the card.\n* **`.card-expand`:** This class styles the expanding section.  `max-height: 0;` keeps it initially collapsed, and `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from peeking out before expansion. The `transition` property is vital for animation.\n* **`.card:hover .card-expand`:** This is where the magic happens. The `:hover` pseudo-class targets the `.card` when the mouse hovers over it.  Then, it changes the `max-height` of the `.card-expand` element to `200px`, causing it to smoothly expand due to the transition.  You can adjust `200px` to control the expanded height.\n\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - :hover Pseudo-class:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS learning):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
