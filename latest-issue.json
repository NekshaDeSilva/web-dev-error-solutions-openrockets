[{"body":"\n**Description:**\n\nWe're experiencing significant performance issues in our application, specifically related to excessive and unnecessary re-renders.  This is particularly noticeable on complex components with numerous child components and prop drilling.  While profiling, we've identified several instances where components are re-rendering even when their props haven't changed, leading to wasted CPU cycles and a sluggish user experience.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\nThe problem is most evident when performing the following actions:\n\n1.  [Describe a specific user action that triggers the performance issue, e.g., \"filtering a large dataset in a table\"].\n2.  [Describe another user action if necessary].\n\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nComponents should only re-render when their props or state change.  We expect the application to be responsive and maintain a smooth framerate even with substantial data manipulation.\n\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nComponents are re-rendering unnecessarily, leading to dropped frames and a noticeable lag in the user interface.  The performance profiler shows a significant number of re-renders in unrelated components, suggesting a cascading effect triggered by a single state change.\n\n\n**Possible Causes (Our Investigation So Far):**\n\n* **Unnecessary state updates:** We suspect some state updates might be triggering re-renders in unintended components. We are currently investigating this possibility.\n* **Missing `useMemo` or `React.memo`:**  We are reviewing our codebase to ensure we are appropriately using `useMemo` for expensive computations and `React.memo` for component optimization.\n* **Implicit dependencies in functional components:** We are looking for instances of missing dependencies in custom hooks or functional components that might be causing unexpected re-renders.\n\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* React Version: [Insert React version]\n* Browser: [Insert Browser and version]\n* Operating System: [Insert OS]\n\n\n**Screenshots/Videos (Optional):**\n\n[Add screenshots or short video clips demonstrating the performance issue if applicable]\n\n\n**Proposed Solution (Optional):**\n\nWe are currently exploring the following solutions:\n\n* More strategic use of `useCallback`\n* Refactoring components to reduce prop drilling\n* Implementing a more efficient state management solution if necessary (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Jotai).\n\n\nWe would appreciate any suggestions or guidance on how to effectively debug and resolve these performance issues.  We've attached a performance profile from [tool used, e.g., React DevTools] for your review.  [Attach profile if possible].\n","number":45,"title":"## Issue: Unexpected re-renders causing performance degradation"}]
