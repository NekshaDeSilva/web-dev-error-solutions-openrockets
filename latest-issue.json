[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating a VideoJS player within a CanvasJS chart visualization. The issue typically manifests as a failure to initialize the VideoJS player, often resulting in a blank space where the player should be. This is frequently caused by conflicts between the JavaScript libraries or improper DOM manipulation.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error isn't a specific error message thrown by either library, but rather a visual one. The VideoJS player container element exists, but the player itself doesn't render. This can be accompanied by errors in the browser's developer console, often related to script loading order or conflicts in jQuery versions (if used).  The CanvasJS chart might render correctly, but the VideoJS player remains absent.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThis solution assumes you're using a basic setup with jQuery.  Adjust paths as needed for your specific project structure.  The problem often lies in the order in which scripts are loaded and how the VideoJS player is initialized after the DOM is ready.\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>CanvasJS & VideoJS Integration</title>\n  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Ensure consistent jQuery version -->\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7.20.3/dist/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7.20.3/dist/video.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script> <!--CanvasJS Library-->\n  </head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"264\"\n        data-setup='{\"sources\": [{\"src\": \"myvideo.mp4\", \"type\": \"video/mp4\"}]}'>\n    </video>\n  <script src=\"script.js\"></script> </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**2. JavaScript (script.js):**\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() { //Ensure DOM is fully loaded before initializing VideoJS.\n\n    //CanvasJS Chart Initialization.\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n      //Your CanvasJS Chart Configuration Here...\n      data: [\n        {\n          type: \"line\",\n          dataPoints: [\n              { x: 10, y: 71 },\n              { x: 20, y: 55 },\n              { x: 30, y: 50 },\n              { x: 40, y: 65 }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n\n\n    //VideoJS Player Initialization after CanvasJS\n    var player = videojs('my-video');\n});\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key change is wrapping the VideoJS initialization within the `$(document).ready()` function.  This ensures that the VideoJS player initialization happens *after* the DOM is fully loaded and CanvasJS has finished rendering.  Inconsistencies in jQuery versions between VideoJS and CanvasJS are another common cause, so using a consistent and widely-supported version like jQuery 3.6.0 (or a newer version if needed) is recommended.  Make sure that your video file `myvideo.mp4` is actually present and accessible at that location.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)\n* **jQuery Documentation:** [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
