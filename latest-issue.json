[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. The card expands vertically to reveal more content when hovered over, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.  We'll achieve this effect using CSS transitions and transforms, keeping the HTML clean and simple. This example utilizes plain CSS3; no frameworks like Tailwind are needed.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is styled with a simple background color and padding.  The key is the use of `max-height` and transitions to control the expansion. On hover, the `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand, and the transition ensures a smooth animation.  A subtle `box-shadow` is added on hover to enhance the visual appeal.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows max-height */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /* Style the content within the card as needed */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content that will expand when you hover over the card.  You can add as much text as you need here and it will smoothly expand to reveal it all.</p>\n    <p>More example text to demonstrate the expansion.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-height: 100px;`**: This initially limits the card's height, hiding the full content.\n* **`transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This CSS property creates a smooth transition for the `max-height` property over 0.3 seconds, using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`max-height: 300px;` (on hover):** This increases the `max-height` on hover, allowing the content to expand. Adjust `300px` to control the final height.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This ensures that any content exceeding the `max-height` is hidden until the card expands.\n* **`box-shadow`**: This adds a subtle shadow for visual enhancement, and is adjusted on hover for additional emphasis.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) (While not directly used here, understanding transforms is beneficial for more advanced card animations.)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
