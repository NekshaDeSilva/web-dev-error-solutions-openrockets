[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. The card expands smoothly to reveal more content when hovered over, creating an engaging interactive element.  We'll leverage CSS transitions and transforms for a polished effect.  This example uses plain CSS3, but the concept could easily be adapted to a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card utilizes a simple structure: a container div holding an image and a content area.  The core effect is achieved by using CSS transitions on `transform` (for scaling) and `opacity` (for a subtle fade-in effect on the content). The `:hover` pseudo-class triggers the animation.  We'll also use some basic box-shadow to enhance the card's visual appeal.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 15px;\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);\n  color: white;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translateY(100%);\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Slight zoom on hover */\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translateY(0);\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is some example content for the expanding card.  It will smoothly appear when you hover over the card.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the animation. It specifies which properties (`transform`, `opacity`) should transition smoothly, the duration (`0.3s`), and the easing function (`ease`).\n* **`transform: scale(1.05);`:** This slightly zooms the card on hover, adding a subtle visual cue.\n* **`transform: translateY(100%);`:** This initially positions the content area off-screen.\n* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** This triggers the animation and changes the styles when the mouse hovers over the card.\n* **`object-fit: cover;`:** Ensures the image covers the entire card area.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** Prevents content from overflowing during the transition.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
