[{"body":"\n**Description:**\n\nWe're experiencing significant performance issues in our application due to excessive re-renders triggered by seemingly innocuous `useState` updates and `useEffect` hooks.  Specifically, when updating a component's state using `useState`, the entire component tree below it re-renders, even when the changes are not relevant to the child components' logic or display. This is leading to noticeable lag and impacting user experience, particularly on less powerful devices.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nWe have a parent component `ParentComponent` that fetches data using `useEffect` and updates its state using `useState`. This state includes an array of items and a loading flag.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction ParentComponent() {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch('/api/items');\n        const data = await response.json();\n        setItems(data);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n      } finally {\n        setIsLoading(false);\n      }\n    };\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isLoading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <ChildComponent items={items} />}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent({ items }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ParentComponent;\n```\n\nEven though `ChildComponent` only depends on the `items` array, it re-renders every time `isLoading` changes.  This unnecessary re-rendering becomes significantly more problematic as the component tree grows in complexity.\n\n**Proposed Solutions/Questions:**\n\n* Are we using `useState` and `useEffect` correctly in this scenario?\n* Should we consider using `useMemo` or `useCallback` to optimize performance?  If so, how should we implement them in this specific context?\n* Are there any other React best practices we should adopt to prevent this issue?\n* Could React.memo be helpful here? If so how should it be implemented?\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* React version: [Insert React Version Here]\n* Browser(s): [List browsers affected]\n* Any relevant code snippets that better illustrate the problem.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nOnly the necessary components should re-render when their respective state changes.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nUnnecessary re-renders are occurring, causing performance degradation.\n\n\nWe would appreciate any guidance on resolving this common performance bottleneck.\n","number":53,"title":"## Issue: Unexpected Re-renders and Performance Degradation with useState and useEffect"}]
