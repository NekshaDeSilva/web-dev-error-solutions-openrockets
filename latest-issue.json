[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using `next/image` within Next.js Middleware or API routes:  the inability to directly use `next/image` components in these contexts.  `next/image` relies on the rendering process of the pages, and those processes aren't available within middleware or API routes.  Attempting to use it will result in errors related to `next/image` not being properly configured or initialized.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nYou'll likely encounter errors similar to these when trying to use `next/image` within middleware or API routes:\n\n* `Error: Image optimization only works within a Next.js application`\n*  `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'config')` (this could stem from incorrect import paths).\n*  `Error: Image component must be wrapped in a Layout` (If attempting to render it on the server-side without proper context.)\n\n\n**Fixing Step-by-Step:**\n\nThe solution is to *not* use `next/image` directly in middleware or API routes. These environments are designed for server-side logic and data manipulation, not for rendering components intended for client-side display.  Instead, you should perform any image processing or manipulation *before* rendering your page component, perhaps even before the middleware is called.\n\nLet's say you want to generate an optimized image URL based on the request in your middleware.  Here's how you might approach it:\n\n\n**1.  Use a different image optimization library (optional, but often preferred):**  Libraries like `sharp` offer server-side image manipulation which is far more flexible than `next/image` within this context.\n\n**2.  Prepare the image URL in Middleware (Example with `sharp`):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport sharp from 'sharp';\nimport fs from 'node:fs/promises';\n\nexport async function middleware(req) {\n  // Only process requests for /image-route\n  if (!req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/image-route')) {\n    return NextResponse.next();\n  }\n\n  const imagePath = '/public/images/original.jpg'; // Path to original image\n\n  try {\n    const imageBuffer = await fs.readFile(imagePath);\n    const resizedImage = await sharp(imageBuffer)\n      .resize({ width: 300, height: 300 })\n      .toBuffer();\n\n    // Create a data URL to embed the image or use the path to a new file\n    const dataUrl = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${resizedImage.toString('base64')}`;\n    //OR create/save the image to public folder and use relative path\n    const resizedImagePath = '/public/images/resized.jpg'\n    await fs.writeFile(resizedImagePath, resizedImage);\n    \n\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/image-page?image='+ resizedImagePath, req.url)); //redirect to page with image URL\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error processing image:', error);\n    return new NextResponse(\"Image processing failed\", { status: 500 });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3.  Use the prepared URL in your page component:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/image-page.js\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router';\n\nexport default function ImagePage() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const imageUrl = router.query.image;\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {imageUrl && (\n          <Image src={imageUrl} alt=\"Resized Image\" width={300} height={300} />\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe example above demonstrates how to use `sharp` to resize the image within the middleware and then pass the optimized URL to the page component.  The key is separating the image manipulation (server-side) from the image rendering (client-side).  This approach ensures proper behavior and avoids the errors associated with using `next/image` in inappropriate contexts.  Using a data URL avoids a separate image file if you want to keep things simpler.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js Image Component documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)\n* [Sharp image processing library](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
