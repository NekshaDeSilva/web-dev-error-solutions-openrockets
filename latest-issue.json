[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Error: Route not found` in Next.js API routes occurs when a request is made to an API endpoint that doesn't exist. This can stem from typos in the route definition, incorrect routing configuration, or a mismatch between the client-side request and the server-side route handler.  This is different from a 404 on a page; this error is specifically thrown during the API route handling process before a response is even sent to the client.  The error usually manifests as a generic 500 error on the client-side.\n\n\n## Code Example and Fixing Steps\n\nLet's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we have an API route at `/api/products` intended to fetch product data, but a typo in the client-side request causes it to call `/api/prodcts`.\n\n**Incorrect Client-Side Request (e.g., in a `fetch` call):**\n\n```javascript\nfetch('/api/prodcts') //Typo here: 'prodcts' instead of 'products'\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n```\n\n**Correct API Route (`pages/api/products.js`):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    const products = [\n      { id: 1, name: 'Product 1' },\n      { id: 2, name: 'Product 2' },\n    ];\n    res.status(200).json(products);\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Fixing Steps:**\n\n1. **Verify the Route Definition:** Double-check that the API route file path (`pages/api/products.js`) matches the URL used in the client-side request (`/api/products`). Correct any typos in either the file path or the request URL.\n\n2. **Inspect Client-Side Code:** Carefully review the code making the API request. Ensure that the URL is accurately constructed and that there are no typos or other errors.  Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see the exact request being made.\n\n\n3. **Check for Case Sensitivity:**  URLs are case-sensitive.  `/api/products` is different from `/api/Products`. Ensure consistency between your client and server.\n\n4. **Examine Next.js Configuration:** While less likely to be the direct cause of this specific error, review your `next.config.js` to ensure there aren't any rewrites or redirects interfering with your API route.\n\n**Corrected Client-Side Request:**\n\n```javascript\nfetch('/api/products') // Corrected URL\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `Route not found` error arises because Next.js's API routes system couldn't locate a handler matching the requested URL. The framework searches for a file within the `pages/api` directory corresponding to the request path. If no such file exists, it throws the error.  This means the server can't even attempt to process the request and respond, resulting in the 500-level error.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/error-handling)\n* [Troubleshooting Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/troubleshooting)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
