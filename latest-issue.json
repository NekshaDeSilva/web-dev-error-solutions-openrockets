[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware to redirect or rewrite requests based on the URL pathname.  The problem arises from inconsistencies in how `request.nextUrl.pathname` behaves, particularly when dealing with trailing slashes.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nMiddleware often relies on `request.nextUrl.pathname` to determine the current path and perform actions accordingly (e.g., redirecting `/about` to `/about/`). However,  depending on the incoming request and Next.js's internal handling,  `request.nextUrl.pathname` might include or omit a trailing slash inconsistently. This can lead to unexpected redirects or rewrites, resulting in infinite redirect loops or incorrect page rendering.\n\n\n**Code Example: Incorrect Implementation**\n\nThis example demonstrates a flawed middleware function that attempts to redirect requests ending with `/about` to `/about` (without trailing slash):\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/about/') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/about', req.url))\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*'\n}\n```\n\nThis code will work correctly for requests like `/about/`, but it will fail for requests like `/about`.  This is because `/about` and `/about/` are treated as different paths by Next.js.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Normalize the Pathname:**  The most robust solution is to normalize the pathname, removing or adding a trailing slash consistently.  We can use a helper function for this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction normalizePath(path) {\n  return path.endsWith('/') ? path.slice(0, -1) : path.endsWith('/') ? path : path + '/';\n}\n```\n\n2. **Implement the Normalized Middleware:**  Use the helper function to handle path normalization within the middleware:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nfunction normalizePath(path) {\n  return path.endsWith('/') ? path.slice(0, -1) : path + '/';\n}\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const normalizedPath = normalizePath(req.nextUrl.pathname);\n  if (normalizedPath === '/about') {  // Compare normalized paths\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/about', req.url)) // Redirect to /about (without trailing slash)\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*'\n}\n```\n\n3. **Consistent Redirection:**  Ensure the target URL in your `NextResponse.redirect` also follows a consistent trailing slash policy (in this case, we're redirecting to `/about` without a trailing slash).\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe improved code first normalizes both the incoming pathname and the target pathname using the `normalizePath` function. This eliminates the ambiguity caused by inconsistent trailing slashes.  By comparing the *normalized* paths, the middleware behaves predictably, regardless of whether the original request included a trailing slash.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js URL Object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/url)\n\n\n**Copyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
