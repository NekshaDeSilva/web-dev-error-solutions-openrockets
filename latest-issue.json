[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using Next.js Middleware:  incorrect handling of `not-found` responses and unintended redirects.  Improperly configured middleware can lead to unexpected 404 errors or redirect loops, negatively impacting the user experience.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe problem arises when middleware attempts to redirect to a non-existent route or fails to handle a `not-found` scenario gracefully.  This often manifests as a redirect loop (the middleware continuously redirects without reaching a valid page) or a persistent 404 error, even if the requested resource might exist through a different path.  This is especially tricky because the error might not surface immediately, becoming apparent only under specific conditions or after deployment.\n\n**Code Example and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where we have a middleware intended to redirect all requests to `/blog` to `/articles`. However, if `/blog` itself doesn't exist, the redirect will fail, leading to a redirect loop or a 404.\n\n**Incorrect Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/articles', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/blog/:path*'\n}\n```\n\nThis middleware will cause a redirect loop if the user directly accesses `/blog` (or any path starting with `/blog`) because there's no actual `/blog` page to begin with.  The only way out will be to manually stop the browser.\n\n**Corrected Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/articles' + req.nextUrl.pathname.substring('/blog'.length), req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/blog/:path*'\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe improved version addresses the issue by understanding that `/blog` might not be an existing page. Instead of a simple redirect to `/articles`, it now redirects to `/articles` *plus* the remaining path from the original URL. This handles cases where users access `/blog/post-one` and redirects it correctly to `/articles/post-one`. If `/blog` itself is accessed, it's correctly redirected to `/articles`\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **`not-found` handling:**  Always include a check within your middleware to handle cases where the target of a redirect doesn't exist.  You can accomplish this using conditional logic and returning a `NextResponse.notFound()` if necessary.\n\n* **Matcher Configuration:** Carefully define your `matcher` in the `config` object.  An overly broad matcher can lead to unintended consequences.\n\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your middleware with various scenarios, including edge cases and potential errors, to ensure its robustness.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
