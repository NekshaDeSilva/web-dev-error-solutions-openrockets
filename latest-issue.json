[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This effect is achieved without JavaScript, relying solely on CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content.  We'll be using standard CSS3 for this implementation.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe core of this effect lies in the use of CSS transitions to smoothly animate the height of the card.  Initially, the card has a fixed height, displaying only a portion of its content.  On hover, the height transitions to a larger value, revealing the hidden content.  We use `overflow: hidden` to initially hide the extra content and then remove the constraint on hover. We'll also add some basic styling for visual appeal.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Initially hide extra content */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: auto; /* Remove height constraint on hover */\n  overflow: visible; /* Show the full content */\n}\n\n.card-content p {\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" style=\"height: 100px;\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample text within the card.  This content is initially hidden and will expand when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>More sample text to demonstrate the expanding effect.  Notice how smoothly the animation transitions.</p>\n    <p>Even more content to make sure the expanding effect is clearly visible.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial; it hides any content that extends beyond the initial height.  `transition: height 0.3s ease` defines a smooth transition for the height property over 0.3 seconds, using an ease timing function.  The initial height is set using inline styles (`style=\"height: 100px;\"`) for demonstration purposes. You can adjust this height to control the initial visibility.\n\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector applies styles when the card is hovered over.  `height: auto;` allows the card to automatically adjust its height to fit the content. `overflow: visible;` ensures the entire content is visible.\n\n* **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content within the card.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
