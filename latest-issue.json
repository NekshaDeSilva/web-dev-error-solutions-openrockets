[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 (IE11).  The issue manifests as a blank space where the chart should be rendered, or a partially rendered chart with missing elements. This is often due to IE11's limited support for certain Canvas features or rendering quirks.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe primary symptom is the failure of a CanvasJS chart to render correctly in IE11.  The browser's developer console might show no specific errors, or it might display vague messages related to rendering or script execution.  The chart's container element might be present, but the chart itself will be missing or incomplete.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThis fix focuses on ensuring compatibility by using a polyfill for missing Canvas features and setting explicit rendering options within CanvasJS.\n\n**1. Include the excanvas polyfill:**\n\nIE8 and below lack crucial Canvas functionality.  While IE11 is technically a more modern browser, using a polyfill can still resolve unexpected rendering issues.  Include the excanvas library in your HTML file *before* the CanvasJS script.  You can download excanvas from various sources (see External References below).\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>CanvasJS Chart</title>\n<script src=\"excanvas.js\"></script>  <!-- Include excanvas polyfill -->\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    // Your chart configuration here... (See example below)\n    title:{\n      text: \"My Chart\"\n    },\n    data: [\n    {\n      type: \"column\",\n      dataPoints: [\n        { x: 10, y: 71 },\n        { x: 20, y: 55},\n        { x: 30, y: 50 },\n        { x: 40, y: 65 }\n      ]\n    }\n    ]\n  });\n  chart.render();\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**2. Configure CanvasJS for IE Compatibility:**\n\nCanvasJS offers options to fine-tune rendering. While not directly addressing the core issue of missing Canvas features in IE, these options can help mitigate some compatibility problems.\n\n\n**3. (Optional)  Use a Different Rendering Engine (if possible):**\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider exploring alternative rendering engines if your project allows. This is a more drastic step and might involve using a different charting library altogether, but it could be necessary for complex charts in legacy browser environments.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe excanvas polyfill provides basic Canvas support for older browsers that lack native Canvas implementation.  Including it before the CanvasJS script ensures that CanvasJS has access to the necessary functions.  The additional CanvasJS configuration options (if needed) help to work around inconsistencies in how different browsers handle rendering.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/docs/](https://canvasjs.com/docs/)  (Check for IE-specific documentation if available)\n* **excanvas (search for a reliable source):** Search for \"excanvas.js\" on a reputable JavaScript library repository like  cdnjs or jsdelivr.  Always be cautious when downloading libraries from untrusted sources.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
