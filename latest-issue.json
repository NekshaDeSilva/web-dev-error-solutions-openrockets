[{"body":"\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe \"Too Many Open Cursors\" error in MongoDB arises when a client application maintains an excessive number of open cursors without closing them properly.  Each cursor represents an open connection to a MongoDB query result set.  If the number of open cursors surpasses the server's configured limit (typically controlled by `wiredTigerCursorCacheSizeMB`), MongoDB will reject further connection attempts or requests, resulting in this error.  This is particularly common in long-running applications that fail to release cursors after data processing.\n\n**Code Example (Illustrative Python with pymongo):**\n\nThis example demonstrates incorrect cursor handling, leading to the error:\n\n```python\nimport pymongo\n\nclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\ndb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\ncollection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n\n# Incorrect cursor handling: cursor is never closed\nfor document in collection.find({}):\n    # Process document\n    print(document)\n\n# Client is not closed, potentially keeping other resources open\n# ... more code ...\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Explicitly Close Cursors:**  The most crucial step is to ensure each cursor is explicitly closed after use.  This releases the server-side resources.\n\n2. **Use `with` Statements (Context Managers):**  Python's `with` statement provides an elegant way to guarantee resource cleanup, even in case of exceptions.\n\n3. **Close the Client Connection:**  Finally, close the `MongoClient` connection when it's no longer needed. This releases all associated resources, including any remaining open cursors.\n\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```python\nimport pymongo\n\nclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\ndb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\ncollection = db[\"mycollection\"]\n\ntry:\n    with collection.find({}) as cursor: # Uses context manager for automatic closure\n        for document in cursor:\n            # Process document\n            print(document)\nexcept pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    client.close() # Ensures client is closed even if errors occur\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code utilizes a `with` statement to manage the cursor. The `cursor` object is automatically closed when the `with` block exits, regardless of whether the loop completes successfully or an exception is raised. The `finally` block guarantees that the `client` connection is closed, preventing resource leaks.  This prevents the accumulation of open cursors, thus resolving the \"Too Many Open Cursors\" error.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **MongoDB Documentation on Cursors:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/)  (Look for sections on cursor management)\n* **pymongo Documentation:** [https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Search for cursor handling and connection management)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
