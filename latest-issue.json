[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when integrating Video.js into responsive web designs is the player failing to adjust its height correctly to maintain aspect ratio.  This often results in the video appearing stretched, squashed, or with significant letterboxing/pillarboxing, especially on different screen sizes or orientations.  The issue arises because the default Video.js setup doesn't automatically handle resizing based on the container's dimensions.  The player might initially render correctly, but fail to adapt when the browser window is resized.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis solution uses CSS and JavaScript to ensure the Video.js player maintains its aspect ratio dynamically.\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\nEnsure your Video.js player is within a container with defined dimensions (or at least a defined aspect ratio).  We'll use a div with the class `video-container`:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\" data-setup=\"{}\">\n    <source src=\"my-video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    <source src=\"my-video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n    <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">\n      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n    </p>\n  </video>\n</div>\n```\n\n**2. CSS Styling:**\n\nThis CSS uses padding to maintain aspect ratio.  We'll assume a 16:9 aspect ratio. Adjust the padding-bottom percentage (56.25%) if you need a different aspect ratio.\n\n```css\n.video-container {\n  position: relative; /* Important for absolute positioning of the video */\n  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */\n  height: 0; /* Ensures the height is determined by the padding-bottom */\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n\n.video-container video {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n\n**3. JavaScript (Optional - for dynamic resizing):**\n\nWhile the CSS solution above works well for most cases, adding a bit of JavaScript enhances responsiveness, especially when the content is dynamically added or the player's dimensions are manipulated via JavaScript. This example uses a simple resize listener:\n\n```javascript\n// Get the video container\nconst videoContainer = document.querySelector('.video-container');\nconst videoPlayer = videoContainer.querySelector('video');\n\n// Function to recalculate the height\nfunction recalculateHeight() {\n  const containerWidth = videoContainer.offsetWidth;\n  const aspectRatio = 16 / 9;\n  videoContainer.style.height = (containerWidth / aspectRatio) + 'px';\n}\n\n// Call recalculateHeight on window resize\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', recalculateHeight);\n\n// Initial call to set the height\nrecalculateHeight();\n\n// This ensures that the Video.js player is properly resized\nvideojs(videoPlayer).ready(function(){\n    this.update(); // Update the video dimensions after the CSS has taken effect\n});\n\n\n```\n\nRemember to include the Video.js library in your project.  You can download it from their website or use a CDN.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe CSS solution leverages the `padding-bottom` trick to maintain aspect ratio. By setting the `height` to `0` and using a percentage `padding-bottom`, the container's height is automatically calculated based on its width, maintaining the desired aspect ratio. The `position: relative` and `position: absolute` on the container and video, respectively, ensures the video fills the entire container.\n\nThe JavaScript portion provides additional flexibility, ensuring the aspect ratio is recalculated on window resize, handling situations where the container's width might change dynamically (e.g., on different screen sizes or after content updates). The `videojs().ready()` call guarantees the Video.js player is fully initialized before adjusting its size.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Video.js Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)  (Check their documentation for the latest API and best practices)\n* **Responsive Design Techniques:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Responsive_Web_Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Responsive_Web_Design) (Learn more about responsive design principles)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
