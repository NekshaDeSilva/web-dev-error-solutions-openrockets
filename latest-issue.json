[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts within Internet Explorer (IE) 11 and older versions: failure to render the chart correctly, often resulting in a blank space where the chart should appear.  This issue stems from limitations in IE's support for modern JavaScript features and Canvas rendering optimizations used by CanvasJS.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe primary symptom is a blank area on the page where your CanvasJS chart is supposed to be displayed.  The browser's developer console might show no errors, or it might display vague errors related to script execution or rendering.  The chart works correctly in modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe solution involves several approaches, prioritizing the most effective one first:\n\n1. **Using a Polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`:** IE's implementation of `requestAnimationFrame` can be problematic. Including a polyfill ensures consistent behavior across browsers.\n\n```javascript\n// Include this at the beginning of your HTML file, preferably within the `<head>` section, or in a separate JS file loaded before your CanvasJS code\nif (!window.requestAnimationFrame) {\n    window.requestAnimationFrame = (function() {\n        return window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||\n               window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||\n               window.oRequestAnimationFrame ||\n               window.msRequestAnimationFrame ||\n               function(callback) {\n                   return window.setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60);\n               };\n    })();\n}\n\n// ... rest of your CanvasJS code ...\n```\n\n2. **Ensuring Proper CanvasJS Inclusion:** Double-check that you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file.  The `<script>` tag should be placed before the part of your code that creates the chart.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Replace with your actual path -->\n```\n\n3. **Conditional Loading for IE (less preferred):** If the above doesn't work and you absolutely must support very old IE versions, you might consider conditionally loading a different charting library (such as Highcharts, which has better IE support) or displaying an alternative message for IE users.  This is less elegant but might be necessary in some situations.\n\n```javascript\nif (/*@cc_on!@*/false || !!document.documentMode) { // Detect IE\n    // Display an alternative message or load a different charting library\n    document.getElementById(\"chartContainer\").innerHTML = \"CanvasJS is not fully supported in your browser. Please upgrade.\";\n} else {\n    // Your existing CanvasJS code here\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `requestAnimationFrame` polyfill addresses the most likely causeâ€”inconsistencies in how IE handles animation requests. By providing a fallback implementation, you ensure smoother and more reliable chart rendering.  The conditional loading strategy is a workaround that sacrifices elegance for compatibility, but should be used cautiously.  Always prioritize fixing the underlying issue whenever possible.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Check for specific IE support information within their documentation)\n* **MDN Web Docs on `requestAnimationFrame`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
