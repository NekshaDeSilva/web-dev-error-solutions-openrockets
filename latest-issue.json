[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11):  charts failing to render correctly or not rendering at all. This is often due to IE11's limitations in handling certain Canvas features or its compatibility with modern JavaScript libraries.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nIn IE11, you might observe the following:\n\n* A blank space where the CanvasJS chart should be.\n* A partially rendered chart with missing elements.\n* Console errors related to Canvas or rendering contexts.\n* General instability or crashes related to the chart.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe most effective solution usually involves using a polyfill to provide missing Canvas functionality that IE11 lacks.  We'll use `excanvas` for this example.  Note that this is an older library;  modern solutions might involve a more recent alternative that supports IE11 and offers improved features.\n\n**Step 1: Include the `excanvas` library.**\n\nAdd the following `<script>` tag in your HTML file, preferably *before* including the CanvasJS script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/excanvas/r3/excanvas.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Step 2: Ensure Correct CanvasJS Inclusion.**\n\nMake sure you have correctly included the CanvasJS library. This usually involves adding a `<script>` tag linking to your CanvasJS files (usually a `canvasjs.min.js` file).\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>  <!-- Replace with your actual path -->\n```\n\n**Step 3:  Verify Chart Initialization.**\n\nConfirm your CanvasJS chart initialization code is correct.  A common example:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        title:{\n            text: \"My Chart\"\n        },\n        data: [\n        {\n            type: \"column\",\n            dataPoints: [\n                { x: 10, y: 71 },\n                { x: 20, y: 55},\n                { x: 30, y: 50 },\n                { x: 40, y: 65 }\n            ]\n        }\n        ]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4:  Check for Container Element.**\n\nMake sure that the element with the ID \"chartContainer\" (or whatever ID you're using) exists in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 500px;\"></div>\n```\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n`excanvas` is a shim that provides a basic implementation of the HTML5 Canvas API for older browsers that lack native support. By including it, you provide a fallback for IE11, allowing CanvasJS to function even without complete native Canvas support.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)  (Check their documentation for browser compatibility information and potential alternative solutions.)\n* **excanvas (archive):**  Finding a reliable, current download link for excanvas might be difficult since it is no longer actively maintained.  Search for \"excanvas\" on a package manager like npm or look for archived versions on GitHub.  Consider modern alternatives for better support and security.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  While `excanvas` might resolve rendering issues in IE11, it's crucial to remember that IE11 is a legacy browser.  Consider upgrading to a modern browser for optimal performance, security, and compatibility with current web technologies.  If supporting IE11 is unavoidable, thorough testing is essential.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
