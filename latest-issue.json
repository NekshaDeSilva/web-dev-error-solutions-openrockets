[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11): the chart failing to render correctly or displaying incorrectly.  This is often due to IE11's limitations in supporting modern JavaScript features and Canvas rendering optimizations used by CanvasJS.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nIn IE11, a CanvasJS chart might display as a blank space, show only part of the chart, or render with visual artifacts.  The browser's developer console might not always provide clear error messages, making debugging challenging.  The problem stems from IE11's incomplete or different implementation of certain HTML5 Canvas functionalities and related JavaScript APIs.\n\n\n**Fixing Steps (Code):**\n\nThis solution focuses on using a compatibility library and ensuring proper inclusion of CanvasJS.\n\n**Step 1: Include the Excanvas library:**\n\nIE8 and below do not support the HTML5 canvas element natively.  While IE11 *does* support it, using Excanvas can improve compatibility and mitigate potential rendering issues.  Although older, it sometimes resolves stubborn quirks.\n\n```html\n<!-- Include Excanvas (for older IE support, even if questionable in IE11) -->\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/excanvas/r3/excanvas.compiled.js\"></script> \n```\n\n**Step 2: Include the CanvasJS library:**\n\nEnsure you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file.  Replace `\"path/to/canvasjs.min.js\"` with the actual path:\n\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Step 3:  Chart Creation (Example):**\n\nThis is an example of creating a simple chart using CanvasJS.  Adapt it to your specific data and chart type.\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = function () {\n  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    animationEnabled: true,\n    title: {\n      text: \"Simple Chart\"\n    },\n    data: [{\n      type: \"column\",\n      dataPoints: [\n        { label: \"Apple\", y: 10 },\n        { label: \"Banana\", y: 15 },\n        { label: \"Orange\", y: 20 }\n      ]\n    }]\n  });\n  chart.render();\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4:  HTML Container:**\n\nRemember to include a `div` element with the ID \"chartContainer\" to host the chart:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 500px;\"></div>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIncluding Excanvas provides a fallback for older rendering engines, potentially resolving underlying issues in IE11's canvas handling.  While not strictly necessary for IE11, its inclusion can sometimes solve subtle discrepancies in how CanvasJS interacts with the browser's rendering pipeline.  This approach is a pragmatic solution; a more modern approach may involve using a more robust polyfill or fully rewriting the rendering logic to use a framework more compatible with IE11 (though this is less likely to be an efficient solution).\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Refer to their documentation for the latest API and usage examples.)\n* **Excanvas GitHub (archived):**  While this library is old and not actively maintained, finding an archived copy can still prove useful for this specific IE11 compatibility issue. Search for \"excanvas\" on GitHub.\n\n**Note:** If the problem persists after these steps, consider checking for conflicts with other JavaScript libraries, inspecting the browser's developer tools for specific errors, or upgrading to a more modern browser.  For production environments, supporting IE11 is becoming increasingly difficult and often considered unsustainable.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
