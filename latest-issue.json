[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the Discord.js library: rate limiting errors.  These errors occur when your bot sends requests to the Discord API too frequently, exceeding the allowed rate limits for specific endpoints.  This can lead to your bot being temporarily or permanently banned.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nDiscord rate limiting errors manifest in several ways, often as HTTP errors (like 429 Too Many Requests) returned by the Discord API.  The error message might indicate a specific bucket that's been exceeded (e.g., a specific channel or guild).  These errors can interrupt the functionality of your bot, causing messages to fail to send, commands to fail to execute, or other unexpected behaviors.\n\n\n## Code: Handling Rate Limits with `retry`\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the `retry` package to gracefully handle rate limits.  This approach allows your bot to automatically retry requests that fail due to rate limiting, with increasing delays between retries.\n\n**Step 1: Install the `retry` package:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install retry\n```\n\n**Step 2: Implement retry logic:**\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst retry = require('retry');\n\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\n// Function to send a message with retry logic\nasync function sendMessageWithRetry(channel, message) {\n  const operation = retry.operation({\n    retries: 5, // Maximum retry attempts\n    factor: 2,   // Exponential backoff factor\n    minTimeout: 1000, // Minimum delay between retries (1 second)\n    maxTimeout: 10000, // Maximum delay between retries (10 seconds)\n    randomize: true // Add some randomness to the delay\n  });\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    operation.attempt(currentAttempt => {\n      channel.send(message)\n        .then(resolve)\n        .catch(error => {\n          if (error.code === 50007 || error.code === 50035 || error.code === 429) { // Rate limit errors codes\n            const retryDelay = operation.retryDelay();\n            console.warn(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${retryDelay}ms (attempt ${currentAttempt + 1} of ${operation.attempts})`);\n            operation.retry(error);\n          } else {\n            operation.stop();\n            reject(error); // Reject other errors\n          }\n        });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async msg => {\n  if (msg.content === '!test') {\n    try {\n      await sendMessageWithRetry(msg.channel, 'This message was sent using retry logic!');\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Failed to send message after multiple retries:', error);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace with your bot token\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe code uses the `retry` package to wrap the `channel.send` operation.  If a rate limit error occurs (codes 50007, 50035, or 429 are checked here, adjust as needed based on the specific error codes you encounter), the `retry` operation automatically retries the message sending after an exponentially increasing delay.  Other errors are propagated to the caller for handling.  This prevents your bot from crashing due to temporary rate limits. The `retryDelay()` function is called to determine the backoff period.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Documentation:** [https://discord.js.org/](https://discord.js.org/)\n* **Retry Package:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/retry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/retry)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits)  (Check this for the most up-to-date information on rate limits.)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
