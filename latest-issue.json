[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware:  incorrectly handling the `request.nextUrl.pathname` property, leading to unintended redirect loops or unexpected behavior.  This often occurs when attempting to redirect based on the current pathname but inadvertently creating a circular redirect.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen using middleware to redirect based on the URL path, developers might incorrectly manipulate the `request.nextUrl.pathname` directly within the middleware function.  If not handled carefully, changing `request.nextUrl.pathname` to a value that already matches the current path (or triggers another redirect to the same path) will create an infinite redirect loop, resulting in a browser error.\n\n**Scenario:** Let's say you want to redirect all requests to `/blog` to `/news` unless the current path is already `/news`.  A naive approach might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (incorrect)\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog')) {\n    req.nextUrl.pathname = '/news';\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);\n  }\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/blog/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\nThis will lead to an infinite loop if the user is already on `/news`.  After the redirect, `req.nextUrl.pathname` will become `/news`, and the condition `req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/blog')` will still be false during the next request from the browser after the initial redirect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe solution involves using the `NextResponse.redirect()` method instead of `NextResponse.rewrite()` and ensuring that the redirect target is different from the current path.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (correct)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const currentPath = req.nextUrl.pathname;\n  if (currentPath.startsWith('/blog') && currentPath !== '/news') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/news', req.url));\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/blog/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`currentPath = req.nextUrl.pathname;`**: We store the original pathname in a variable to avoid modifying the original request URL object.\n\n2. **`if (currentPath.startsWith('/blog') && currentPath !== '/news')`**: This condition checks if the path starts with `/blog` *and* is not already `/news`. This prevents the infinite redirect loop.\n\n3. **`return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/news', req.url));`**:  `NextResponse.redirect()` performs a proper HTTP redirect, ensuring the browser gets a new response with the correct status code. Using `new URL('/news', req.url)` constructs a correctly formatted URL, using the original request's base URL to avoid potential issues with relative paths.\n\n4. **`return NextResponse.next();`**: If the condition is false (the path doesn't start with `/blog` or it's already `/news`), the middleware continues processing the request without interfering.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\n**Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
