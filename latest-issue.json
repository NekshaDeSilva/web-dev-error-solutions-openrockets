[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect utilizes CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to create a smooth and visually appealing animation.  We'll be using plain CSS3 for this example.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts with a compact layout. Upon hovering over the card, its height expands to reveal hidden content.  The expansion is smoothly animated using CSS transitions.  We'll style the card with a subtle shadow and rounded corners for a modern look.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 250px; /* Height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 14px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is the content of the expanding card.  It's initially hidden, but revealed on hover.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to prevent content from spilling out during the height transition.  The `transition` property defines the animation for the `height` property, making the expansion smooth.  The initial `height` is set to a small value.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `height` is increased to reveal the hidden content.\n* **`.card-content`, `.card-title`, `.card-text`:** These classes provide basic styling for the card's content, title, and text respectively.  You can customize these styles further to match your design preferences.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:**  [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n* **CSS Box Model:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
