[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: the dreaded \"Response already sent\" error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to send a response from your middleware more than once, leading to unpredictable behavior and application crashes.  This often stems from a misunderstanding of how middleware functions and its interaction with other parts of your application.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Response already sent` error in Next.js middleware signifies that the HTTP response has already been committed to the client.  Subsequent attempts to modify or send another response will result in this error.  This is a crucial aspect of HTTP protocol; you can only send a single response per request.  In middleware, this often happens when you inadvertently call `next()` multiple times or try to send a response directly alongside modifying the response using methods like `setHeader`.\n\n**Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we want to add a header to every request and redirect specific requests based on a condition. An incorrect implementation might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  url.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'Middleware Value'); // Correctly sets header\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/admin') {\n    url.pathname = '/login';  // Correctly redirects\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url); //Incorrect: sends the response\n  }\n  //Incorrect: This line is never reached because the response was already sent.\n  NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/home',req.url));\n\n  return NextResponse.next(url); // Correctly passes control to the next handler\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/'], // Matches specific routes\n};\n```\n\nThis code has two critical flaws:\n\n1. It calls `NextResponse.redirect` inside the `if` block.  This sends a response immediately.\n2. After the `if` block it attempts to send another response using `NextResponse.rewrite`.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n  url.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'Middleware Value');\n\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/admin') {\n    url.pathname = '/login';\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url); \n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next(url);\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe corrected code ensures that only one `NextResponse` object is returned. The `if` statement handles the redirect, and if the condition is false, `NextResponse.next(url)` passes control to the next handler in the request pipeline (e.g., the page component or API route). The header is correctly set before the conditional logic, ensuring it's always added irrespective of the redirection. Importantly, only one `return` statement exists, avoiding the double response error.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMiddleware in Next.js runs before any page or API route is processed.  It's designed for actions like authentication, redirection, and adding headers. Understanding that it works with a single response per request is key to avoiding this common error.  Always ensure you have only one `return` statement with a single `NextResponse` object, carefully managing conditional logic to avoid sending multiple responses.\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
