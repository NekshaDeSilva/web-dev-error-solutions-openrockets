[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Error: Route is defined twice` error.  This typically occurs when you accidentally define the same middleware route multiple times, either explicitly or implicitly through conflicting configurations.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Error: Route is defined twice` error in Next.js Middleware means that your application has attempted to register the same middleware route path twice.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and prevent your application from starting correctly.  Next.js can't determine which middleware function to use, resulting in this error.  The error message may not always explicitly state that the route is defined twice but will indicate a problem with route registration.\n\n\n## Code Example & Fixing Steps\n\nLet's illustrate this with an example. Suppose you have two middleware files: `middleware.js` and `another-middleware.js`, both attempting to handle requests to `/api/products`:\n\n**`middleware.js` (incorrect):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  console.log('Middleware 1 running');\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/products',\n};\n```\n\n**`another-middleware.js` (incorrect):**\n\n```javascript\n// another-middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  console.log('Middleware 2 running');\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/products',\n};\n```\n\n**The Problem:** Both files define middleware for `/api/products`.  This will trigger the `Error: Route is defined twice` error.\n\n**Fixing the Problem:**\n\n1. **Consolidate Middleware:** The best approach is to combine the logic from both middleware files into a single file. This avoids the conflict.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // middleware.js (consolidated)\n   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\n   export function middleware(req) {\n     console.log('Consolidated middleware running');\n     // Combine logic from both original middleware files here.\n     return NextResponse.next();\n   }\n\n   export const config = {\n     matcher: '/api/products',\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove Redundant Middleware:** If the middleware functions have different purposes, use a more specific matcher in one or both to avoid overlap.  For example, if one deals with authentication and the other with data fetching:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // middleware.js\n   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\n   export function middleware(req) {\n     console.log('Authentication Middleware running');\n     // Authentication logic\n     return NextResponse.next();\n   }\n\n   export const config = {\n     matcher: '/api/products/auth', // More specific matcher\n   };\n   ```\n\n   ```javascript\n   // another-middleware.js\n   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\n   export function middleware(req) {\n     console.log('Data Fetching Middleware running');\n     // Data fetching logic\n     return NextResponse.next();\n   }\n\n   export const config = {\n     matcher: '/api/products/:path*', // Matches /api/products/*\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Implicit Conflicts:** Look at your `next.config.js` file for any middleware configurations that might be unintentionally overlapping with your explicitly defined middleware files.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `matcher` property in the `config` object determines which routes the middleware function applies to.  If multiple middleware functions have overlapping `matcher` values, Next.js cannot resolve the conflict, resulting in the error.  By consolidating the logic or using more specific matchers, you ensure that each route is handled by only one middleware function.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - The official Next.js documentation on middleware.\n* [Next.js Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing) -  General information on Next.js routing which is essential to understand middleware context.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
