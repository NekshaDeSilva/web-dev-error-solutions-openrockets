[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required!  This example uses plain CSS3, but the concepts could easily be adapted to a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over. The expansion reveals hidden content within the card.  The animation is smooth and uses pure CSS transitions.  We achieve this primarily using the `height` property and transitions, along with some clever use of overflow to initially hide the content.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Initially hides the expanded content */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: auto; /* Allows the card to expand to its content's height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n\n.initially-hidden {\n  height: 0; /* Initially hides this section */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing while hidden */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover .initially-hidden {\n  height: auto; /* Shows the content on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some example text for the card.  It will expand when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <div class=\"initially-hidden\">\n      <p class=\"card-text\">This paragraph is initially hidden and will only be revealed on hover.  You can add as much content as you like here.</p>\n      <p class=\"card-text\">This is another paragraph of hidden content.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is crucial. It initially hides the extra content of the `initially-hidden` div, preventing it from affecting the card's initial height.\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease;`:** This creates a smooth animation when the height of the card changes.  The `ease` timing function provides a comfortable transition.\n* **`.card:hover { height: auto; }`:** On hover, the card's height is set to `auto`, allowing it to dynamically adjust to the content's height, including the now-visible hidden section.\n* **`.initially-hidden` and `.card:hover .initially-hidden`:** These selectors work in tandem to control the visibility of the extra content.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Animations:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)\n* **Understanding `overflow` property:** [CSS-Tricks - Understanding Overflow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/overflow/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
