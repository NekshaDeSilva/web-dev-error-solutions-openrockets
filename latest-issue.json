[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common error encountered when developing Node.js applications, especially when using modules (like those installed via npm or yarn), is the dreaded \"Module not found\" error.  This typically occurs when your code tries to import or require a module that Node.js cannot locate in your project's file system or within its search paths.  The error message might vary slightly, but it usually includes a path pointing to the missing module.  For example:\n\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'my-missing-module'\n```\n\nThis indicates that your code is trying to use `my-missing-module` but Node.js cannot find it.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis problem stems from several possible causes.  Let's address the most common ones:\n\n**1. Incorrect Installation:**\n\n* **Problem:** The module might not be installed correctly or might be missing entirely.\n* **Solution:**  Ensure the module is installed in your project's dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and run:\n  ```bash\n  npm install my-missing-module\n  ```\n  or\n  ```bash\n  yarn add my-missing-module\n  ```\n  Replace `my-missing-module` with the actual name of the module.\n\n\n**2. Incorrect Import/Require Path:**\n\n* **Problem:** The path in your `import` or `require` statement might be incorrect.  Relative paths are especially prone to errors.\n* **Solution:** Double-check the path. Make sure it correctly points to the location of the module. For example:\n\n   **Incorrect:**\n   ```javascript\n   import MyModule from './my-module'; // If my-module.js is in a subfolder\n   ```\n\n   **Correct:**\n   ```javascript\n   import MyModule from './subfolder/my-module';\n   ```\n   or (using absolute paths, less recommended for maintainability)\n   ```javascript\n   import MyModule from '/Users/username/projects/myproject/subfolder/my-module';\n   ```\n\n**3. Incorrect Module Name:**\n\n* **Problem:** You might have misspelled the module's name in your `import` or `require` statement.\n* **Solution:** Verify the module name using the package's official documentation or npm/yarn search.\n\n\n**4. Missing `package.json` entry:**\n\n* **Problem:**  If you're using a module in a subdirectory and you are referring to it with a relative path in other files (from outside that directory), it might not be recognized.\n* **Solution:** This depends on how your modules are structured. If your project structure involves subdirectories with modules, ensure your project's `package.json` points to the correct module locations through the `main` property. If it's not enough consider using workspaces.\n\n\n\n\n**5. Caching Issues:**\n\n* **Problem:** Node.js's module cache might be holding an outdated version of the module information.\n* **Solution:** Clear the module cache:\n  ```bash\n  npm cache clean --force\n  ```\n  or\n  ```bash\n  yarn cache clean\n  ```\n  Then, reinstall the module.\n\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nNode.js uses a module system to organize and reuse code. When your code uses `require()` or `import`, Node.js searches for the specified module in a specific order:\n\n1. **Local directory:** It first looks in the current directory.\n2. **node_modules:** Then, it checks the `node_modules` folder in the current directory and its parent directories (all the way up to the root of your filesystem).\n3. **Built-in modules:** Finally, it checks for built-in Node.js modules.\n\nIf the module isn't found in any of these locations, the \"Module not found\" error occurs.  The solutions outlined above address the most likely reasons why this might happen.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Node.js Documentation on Modules:** [https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)\n* **npm Documentation:** [https://docs.npmjs.com/](https://docs.npmjs.com/)\n* **yarn Documentation:** [https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/introduction](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/introduction)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
