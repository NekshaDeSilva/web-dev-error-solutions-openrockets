[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using CanvasJS charts within Internet Explorer 11 (IE11):  charts failing to render correctly or not rendering at all.  IE11's older rendering engine often struggles with certain CanvasJS features or requires specific configuration.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe most frequent symptom is a blank space where the chart should be displayed.  There might be no error messages in the browser's console, making debugging difficult.  Sometimes, parts of the chart might render, but others will be missing or distorted. This is particularly noticeable with complex charts containing many data points or interactive elements.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nThe primary cause is often a compatibility issue with older versions of excanvas.js, a library used by CanvasJS to emulate the HTML5 canvas element in older browsers.  The solution usually involves including a compatible version of excanvas.js or ensuring that it is properly included and loaded *before* the CanvasJS script.  Note: CanvasJS officially no longer supports IE11, so this might be a temporary fix until upgrading is possible.\n\n**1. Include the Correct excanvas.js:**\n\n   Download a compatible version of excanvas.js (older versions sometimes work better with IE11 than newer ones). You can find this through searches such as \"excanvas.js download\".  Do not rely on CDN links that may point to incompatible versions.\n\n\n**2. Modify your HTML:**\n\n   Ensure that `excanvas.js` is included *before* the CanvasJS script in your HTML `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<script src=\"excanvas.js\"></script> <!-- This line is crucial -->\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script> </head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<script>\n    window.onload = function () {\n        var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n            // your chart configuration here...\n            data: [\n                {\n                    type: \"column\",\n                    dataPoints: [\n                        { label: \"Apple\", y: 10 },\n                        { label: \"Banana\", y: 15 },\n                        { label: \"Orange\", y: 20 }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        });\n        chart.render();\n    }\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**3.  Browser Compatibility Mode (Consider this only if other solutions fail):**\n\nIn some cases, forcing IE11 to use a specific document mode can help. However, this is a less preferred solution as it can have unintended side effects on other parts of your website. You can attempt this by adding the following meta tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML:\n\n```html\n<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=EmulateIE8\">\n```\n\n*Experiment with different `IE=...` values (e.g., IE=EmulateIE7, IE=9) if necessary*.  However, keep in mind that using EmulateIE8 will make your website work in a way that may also not meet the requirements of CanvasJS.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIE11's limitations with the HTML5 canvas element necessitate the use of a compatibility library like excanvas.js. By ensuring this library is loaded correctly and before the CanvasJS script, we provide CanvasJS with the necessary tools to render the charts properly.  The order of script inclusion is vital; placing `excanvas.js` after CanvasJS will often lead to rendering failures. Using a specific browser compatibility mode is a last resort, as it implies potential compatibility problems and the need for updating browsers.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [CanvasJS Documentation](https://canvasjs.com/docs/):  While not directly addressing this IE11 issue specifically, the official documentation provides general guidance on chart configuration and troubleshooting.\n* [Excanvas.js (search for downloads):](Search engines like Google or Bing are required to find suitable downloads.  Beware of potentially outdated or insecure sources.)  Finding a compatible version of excanvas.js is key, as newer versions are not guaranteed to work with IE11.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
