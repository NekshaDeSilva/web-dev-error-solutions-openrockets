[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using the `dotenv` package in Node.js applications: **failure to load environment variables correctly**.  This often manifests as undefined variables in your application despite having a `.env` file in the correct location.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe most frequent symptom is receiving `ReferenceError: process.env.<YOUR_VARIABLE> is not defined` when trying to access environment variables you've defined in your `.env` file. This indicates that `dotenv` hasn't loaded the variables into the `process.env` object properly.  This can happen due to incorrect file paths, improper configuration, or conflicts with other modules.\n\n**Code and Fixing Steps:**\n\nLet's assume we have a `.env` file in the root of our project containing:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase\nAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\nAnd a `server.js` file:\n\n```javascript\n// Incorrect implementation - likely source of the error\n// const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n// const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;\n\n// console.log(databaseUrl); // Throws error if dotenv is not loaded correctly\n// console.log(apiKey);\n\n\n// Correct implementation\nrequire('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables BEFORE other imports\n\nconst databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\nconst apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;\n\nconsole.log(databaseUrl);\nconsole.log(apiKey);\n\n//Rest of your server code...\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe crucial step is ensuring that `require('dotenv').config()` is called **before** any other code that attempts to access environment variables.  Node.js executes code line by line, so if you try to access `process.env.DATABASE_URL` *before* `dotenv` has loaded the `.env` file, it will be undefined.\n\nThe corrected `server.js` code places `require('dotenv').config()` at the very beginning. This loads the `.env` file and populates `process.env` with its contents *before* the subsequent code attempts to use these variables.  Failure to do so is the most common cause of this error.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **`dotenv` npm package:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)  -  Official documentation for the `dotenv` package.\n* **Node.js documentation on `process.env`:** [https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processenv) - Explains how Node.js handles environment variables.\n\n**Further Troubleshooting:**\n\n* **Verify `.env` file path:** Double-check that your `.env` file is in the correct directory (usually the root of your project).  Relative paths in `require()` statements are relative to the current file.\n* **File Permissions:** Ensure the `.env` file has the correct read permissions.\n* **`gitignore`:**  Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information to your version control repository.\n* **Multiple `.env` files:** If you have multiple `.env` files (e.g., for different environments like development and production), make sure you are loading the correct one. You might need to use conditional logic to load a different `.env file based on environment variables or command-line arguments.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
