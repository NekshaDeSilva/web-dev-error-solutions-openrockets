[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  This effect involves a card that reveals more content upon hovering or clicking. We'll achieve this using pure CSS, avoiding any JavaScript.  This example uses standard CSS3, but could easily be adapted to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is designed with a basic structure: a container holding an image and some text.  The key to the expanding effect is the use of CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class. On hover, the card's height increases to reveal hidden content, smoothly transitioning due to the applied transitions.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n  display: block; /* Removes extra space below the image */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content until expanded */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  height: 100px; /* Height when expanded */\n}\n\n/* Optional: Add some styling for the text content */\n.card-content p {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is some extra content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>More text can be added here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`.card`**: This class styles the overall card, including width, border radius, shadow and the crucial `transition` property for smooth animations.\n*   **`.card img`**:  This styles the image to fit the card's width. `display: block` prevents the image from creating extra spacing.\n*   **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content area.  `height: 0` initially hides the content, and `overflow: hidden` ensures that the hidden content doesn't cause layout issues.  The `transition` property mirrors that of the `.card` class.\n*   **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This is the key selector.  It targets the `.card-content` only when the `.card` is hovered over, setting the `height` to `100px` (or adjust as needed) to reveal the content.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n*   **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n*   **CSS Tricks Website:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (Search for \"card hover effects\" or similar)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
