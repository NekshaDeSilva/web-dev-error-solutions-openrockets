[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware: incorrectly handling `404 Not Found` responses and how to prevent them from interfering with other middleware functions or page rendering.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen using Next.js Middleware, a `Response.notFound()` call within a middleware function intended to handle a specific route or pattern might inadvertently trigger a 404 response for *all* subsequent middleware functions and even the page itself, even if those subsequent functions or the page should rightfully exist.  This happens because middleware execution stops immediately upon encountering a `Response.notFound()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, where valid pages or API routes appear to be broken.\n\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet's say we have middleware designed to redirect `/old-blog` to `/blog` and another middleware that handles authentication. If the `/old-blog` redirect fails (e.g., due to a missing `/blog` page), the `notFound()` call in the redirect middleware prematurely stops execution. The authentication middleware won't run, and the user will see a 404, rather than a proper authentication failure or redirect.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume we have two middleware functions: one for redirects and one for authentication.\n\n**Incorrect Middleware (Problem):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname\n\n  if (path === '/old-blog') {\n    // Incorrect handling: Response.notFound() prematurely stops all middleware\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/blog', req.url))\n  }\n\n  if (req.cookies.get('authToken') === null) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/old-blog', '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'], // This matcher covers most of the app, potentially leading to unexpected 404s\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Middleware (Solution):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const path = req.nextUrl.pathname\n\n  if (path === '/old-blog') {\n    try {\n      // Rewrite, handling potential errors explicitly\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/blog', req.url))\n    } catch (error) {\n      // Log the error for debugging\n      console.error(\"Error rewriting URL:\", error)\n      // Continue middleware chain.  Could return a default 404 or proceed to the next middleware check.\n      // Returning nothing lets the middleware chain continue\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (req.cookies.get('authToken') === null) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/old-blog', '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected middleware uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the rewrite.  If the rewrite to `/blog` fails (because `/blog` doesn't exist), the `catch` block executes. Instead of immediately returning `notFound()`, it logs the error (crucial for debugging) and then allows the middleware chain to continue. The authentication middleware will still be executed.  Alternatively, you can add a specific response inside the `catch` to handle the situation gracefully.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully handling potential errors within your Next.js Middleware functions and avoiding premature `Response.notFound()` calls, you can ensure the smooth operation of your application's routing and prevent unexpected 404 errors from disrupting other parts of your middleware chain.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
