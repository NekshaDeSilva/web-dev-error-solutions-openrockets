[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. The card reveals additional content upon hover, offering a smooth and engaging user experience. We'll achieve this effect using CSS transitions and transforms.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card features a simple design.  On hover, the card expands horizontally, revealing hidden content.  This expansion is coupled with a subtle opacity change to further enhance the visual effect. The styling is clean and modern, easily adaptable to various themes.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content outside the card */\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scaleX(1.1); /* Expand horizontally on hover */\n  opacity: 0.9; /* Slightly reduce opacity on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card-content-hidden {\n  opacity: 0;\n  height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the extra content initially */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out, height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content-hidden {\n  opacity: 1;\n  height: auto; /* Reveal hidden content on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>This is the Title</h2>\n    <p>This is the main content of the card.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card-content card-content-hidden\">\n    <p>This is the additional content revealed on hover.</p>\n    <p>More details here...</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the animation.  It specifies that the `transform` and `opacity` properties will smoothly transition over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`transform: scaleX(1.1)`:** This scales the card horizontally by 110% on hover, creating the expansion effect.\n* **`opacity`:**  The subtle opacity change adds depth and visual feedback.\n* **`.card-content-hidden`:** This class initially hides the extra content using `opacity: 0` and `height: 0`. The `overflow: hidden` prevents the hidden content from affecting the layout. On hover, its `opacity` and `height` are transitioned to reveal the content.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
