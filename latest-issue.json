[{"body":"\n**Description:**\n\nWe're experiencing unexpected and inefficient re-renders in several components due to the shallow comparison performed by `useState`.  Specifically, when updating an object or array within the state, even if only a deeply nested property changes, the entire component re-renders. This is impacting performance, particularly in components with complex state structures and frequent updates.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say we have a component managing a list of users:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction UserList() {\n  const [users, setUsers] = useState([\n    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', details: { age: 30, city: 'New York' } },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', details: { age: 25, city: 'Los Angeles' } }\n  ]);\n\n  const updateAge = (userId, newAge) => {\n    setUsers(prevUsers => {\n      return prevUsers.map(user => {\n        if (user.id === userId) {\n          return { ...user, details: { ...user.details, age: newAge } };\n        }\n        return user;\n      });\n    });\n  };\n\n  // ... rest of the component ...\n}\n```\n\nEven though only the `age` property of a single user is modified, the entire `users` array is considered different by the shallow comparison, triggering a full re-render of the `UserList` component and all its children.  This is inefficient, especially with large datasets.\n\n\n**Proposed Solutions/Discussion:**\n\nWe're exploring several solutions:\n\n* **Immer:** Using the `Immer` library to create immutable updates, allowing React to perform a more efficient comparison.\n* **useReducer:**  Switching to `useReducer` for managing more complex state and potentially using custom reducers to optimize updates.\n* **Selective updates (if possible):** Identifying areas where we can avoid updating the entire structure and only update the necessary parts of the state.\n\nWe'd appreciate any suggestions on the best approach to resolve this issue, considering performance optimization and maintainability.  Are there any other libraries or techniques that could be helpful in this scenario?  What are the potential drawbacks of each proposed solution?\n\n\n**Relevant Code Snippets:** (Add relevant code snippets here if necessary)\n\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nOnly the necessary parts of the component should re-render when a deeply nested property changes within the state.\n\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe entire component re-renders, causing performance issues.\n\n\n**Environment:**\n\n* React version: [Insert React version]\n* Browser: [Insert browser and version]\n* Operating System: [Insert operating system]\n\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nAdd any other relevant information.\n","number":44,"title":"## Issue: Unexpected re-renders due to shallow comparison in useState"}]
