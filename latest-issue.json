[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nOne of the most common errors developers encounter when using Discord.js is hitting rate limits.  Discord's API has rate limits to prevent abuse and maintain server stability.  When your bot sends too many requests within a short period, Discord will respond with a 429 error (\"Too Many Requests\"). This can manifest in various ways, from your bot temporarily stopping its functionality to being completely unresponsive.  The error message often includes details about the remaining time until the rate limit resets and the global/per-route bucket it applies to.\n\n## Fixing the Error Step-by-Step\n\nThis example demonstrates handling rate limits for sending messages.  Adjust it for other API endpoints as needed.  The key is using `setTimeout` to delay subsequent requests until the rate limit resets.\n\n**Step 1: Install the necessary package:**\n\nIf you haven't already, install `discord.js`\n\n```bash\nnpm install discord.js\n```\n\n**Step 2: Implement Rate Limit Handling:**\n\nThis code snippet utilizes `setTimeout` to handle rate limits. It checks the response headers for rate limit information and delays further requests accordingly.  It also utilizes an async/await pattern for cleaner code.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async msg => {\n  if (msg.content === '!rateLimitTest') {\n    try {\n      for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n        await sendMessageWithRateLimit(msg, `Message ${i + 1}`);\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error sending messages:\", error);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nasync function sendMessageWithRateLimit(msg, content) {\n    try{\n        const message = await msg.reply(content);\n        console.log(\"Message sent:\", content);\n    } catch(error) {\n        if(error.code === 50007){ // 50007 = cannot send message to this user\n            console.error(\"Cannot send to this user.\")\n            return;\n        }\n        if (error.httpStatus === 429) {\n          console.log('Rate limited. Waiting...', error);\n          const retryAfter = error.headers['retry-after'] || 1000; // Default to 1s if not specified\n          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter)); // Wait before retrying\n          return await sendMessageWithRateLimit(msg, content)\n        }\n        console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n        throw error;\n      }\n}\n\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace with your bot token\n```\n\n\n**Step 3:  Understanding the Code**\n\n* The `sendMessageWithRateLimit` function attempts to send a message.\n* It catches the error and if the error code is 429, it logs the issue, gets the retry-after time from the header, or defaults to 1000 milliseconds.\n* `setTimeout` pauses execution, giving time for the rate limit to reset.  The function then recursively calls itself to retry sending the message.\n* Error handling for other errors is included for robustness.\n*  Importantly the code gracefully handles user errors (50007) to avoid crashes.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nDiscord.js doesn't automatically handle rate limits.  The code above provides a robust mechanism to detect 429 errors, extract the necessary retry time from the response headers and retry sending the message once the rate limit is lifted. This prevents the bot from crashing and ensures your bot continues to function correctly.  Always check the Discord API documentation for specific rate limit details for various endpoints.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Documentation:** [https://discord.js.org/](https://discord.js.org/)  (Refer to the API documentation for specific rate limit information for different endpoints.)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) (Official Discord documentation on rate limits)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
