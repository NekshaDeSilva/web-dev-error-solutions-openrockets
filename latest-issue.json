[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: the inability to import modules from `next/server` within pages or components designed for client-side rendering.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nAttempting to import functions or components from `next/server` (like `NextResponse` or `redirect`) within a client-side component or page results in a runtime error.  This is because `next/server` is specifically designed for server-side code execution within Middleware and API routes.  The modules within `next/server` are not available in the browser's JavaScript environment.  The error message might vary, but it essentially communicates that a module or function is not defined.  For example: `ReferenceError: NextResponse is not defined` or similar.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you tried to use `NextResponse` in a page component to perform a redirect based on some client-side condition. This would be incorrect.\n\n**Incorrect Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/my-page.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n  const shouldRedirect = true; // Determined by client-side logic\n\n  if (shouldRedirect) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-page', location.href));\n  }\n\n  return <div>My Page</div>;\n}\n\nexport default MyPage;\n```\n\nThis code will throw an error because `NextResponse` is attempted to be used on the client-side.\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nThe correct approach involves leveraging Middleware for server-side redirects or using client-side routing mechanisms for client-side decisions. Here's how to resolve this using Middleware:\n\n1. **Create a Middleware file:** Create a file within the `middleware` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).  For example, `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`.\n\n\n2. **Import `NextResponse` correctly:** Import `NextResponse` within your Middleware file.\n\n3. **Implement Redirection Logic:**  Use `NextResponse.redirect` within your middleware function to perform the redirection based on server-side conditions (or conditions you can determine on the server).  Do NOT attempt to rely on client-side data here.\n\n**Corrected Code (Middleware):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  // Example condition based on a query parameter\n  if (req.nextUrl.searchParams.get('redirect') === 'true') {\n      url.pathname = '/new-page';\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(url); //or NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/my-page'], // Apply middleware only to /my-page\n};\n```\n\n4. **Update your page:** Your `pages/my-page.js` now no longer needs the `NextResponse` import. It can focus purely on client-side rendering.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/my-page.js\nfunction MyPage() {\n  return <div>My Page</div>;\n}\n\nexport default MyPage;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code uses Next.js Middleware to handle the redirection. Middleware runs on the server before the page is rendered.  This allows the use of `next/server` modules without encountering the \"not defined\" error. The `matcher` property in the `config` object specifies the paths to which the middleware applies.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n\n\n**Copyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
