[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect involves a card that expands to reveal more content when hovered over, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.  We'll leverage CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a simple design with a background color and padding. The key to the expanding effect lies in the use of CSS transitions on the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties. On hover, the card scales up slightly, creating an expanding animation.  Simultaneously, a subtle box shadow appears, adding depth and highlighting the interaction.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transitions */\n  width: 300px;\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate interactivity */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand on hover */\n  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Add a shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /*Content Styling*/\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is a simple card that expands on hover, showcasing a CSS-only animation effect.  No JavaScript required!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial. It defines the transition properties for `transform` and `box-shadow`.  `0.3s` sets the duration of the transition, and `ease-in-out` specifies the timing function, creating a smooth animation.\n\n* **`transform: scale(1.05);`**: This line, within the `:hover` pseudo-class, scales the card up by 5% on hover, creating the expanding effect.\n\n* **`box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`**: This line adds a box shadow to the card on hover, giving it more depth and visual feedback.  The `rgba` value allows you to control the shadow's opacity.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Pseudo-classes:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
