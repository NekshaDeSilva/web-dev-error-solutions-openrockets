[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly expand a card when it's hovered over.  No JavaScript is required.  We'll be using plain CSS3 for this example.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts with minimal dimensions. On hover, the card expands to reveal more content, while maintaining a smooth animation. The expansion is achieved by increasing the width and height of the card and subtly changing its shadow.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition on hover */\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevent content overflow before expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand the card on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate interactivity */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /* Style the inner content as needed */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some sample text inside the expanding card.  You can add more content here as needed.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;`**: This line applies a smooth transition to the `transform` and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds, using an ease timing function. This creates the smooth animation.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1);`**: This line scales the card up by 10% on hover, creating the expanding effect.\n* **`box-shadow`**: The box-shadow is adjusted on hover to further enhance the visual effect of expansion.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents content from spilling outside the card before expansion.  Without this, you might see content clipping.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Box-Shadow:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
