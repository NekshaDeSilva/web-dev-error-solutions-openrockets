[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  The card expands smoothly to reveal more content when hovered, using only CSS transitions and transforms.  No JavaScript is required. We'll primarily use standard CSS3 properties; however, you could easily adapt this using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis effect uses a combination of CSS transitions and transforms to create a smooth, expanding animation. The card's height expands on hover, and the inner content smoothly slides into view.  We'll also add a subtle shadow effect to enhance the visual appeal.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  width: 300px; /* Adjust as needed */\n  height: 150px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for content slide */\n  transform: translateY(-150px); /* Initially hides the content off-screen */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  transform: translateY(0); /* Reveals the content on hover */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some example text that will be revealed when the card is hovered.</p>\n    <p>Add more content here as needed.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the card itself.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial to keep the content contained during the expansion.  The `transition` property applies a smooth animation to the `height` change on hover.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it, increasing the `height`.\n* **`.card-content`**: This class styles the inner content of the card.  `transform: translateY(-150px)` initially positions the content off-screen. The transition on `transform` ensures a smooth slide.\n* **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This selector targets the inner content when hovering over the card, resetting the `transform` to reveal the content.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
