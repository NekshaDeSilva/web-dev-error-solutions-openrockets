[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. We'll achieve this using CSS transitions and transforms, resulting in a smooth and visually appealing animation.  This example uses plain CSS; adapting it to Tailwind CSS is straightforward by replacing class names with their Tailwind equivalents.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts with minimal dimensions. On hover, the card smoothly expands to a larger size, accompanied by a subtle shadow effect that adds depth. The transition is implemented using CSS transitions, ensuring a smooth animation.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for all properties */\n  width: 200px; /* Initial width */\n  height: 150px; /* Initial height */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 300px; /* Expanded width */\n  height: 250px; /* Expanded height */\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n  transform: translateY(-5px); /* Slight lift on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>Hover over me!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;`:** This line is crucial. It applies a transition to all CSS properties that change, making the animation smooth.  `0.3s` is the duration, and `ease-in-out` defines the timing function (how the speed changes during the transition).\n\n* **`:hover` Selector:**  This selector targets the element when the mouse hovers over it.\n\n* **`width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, `transform`:** These properties change on hover, creating the expansion and shadow effects. The `transform: translateY(-5px);` subtly lifts the card on hover, adding a nice visual touch.\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This is important to prevent the content inside the card from overflowing during the expansion animation.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** (Search for \"CSS animations\" or \"CSS transitions\" on their website for numerous tutorials and examples)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
