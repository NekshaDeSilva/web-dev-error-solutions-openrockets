[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that expands vertically to reveal additional content when hovered over.  A subtle shadow effect enhances the visual appeal.  This example uses plain CSS3, but the concepts could easily be adapted to frameworks like Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe styling leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve the expansion effect.  The card's height transitions smoothly from a compact size to a larger size upon hover.  A box-shadow is added to create a subtle, three-dimensional effect that intensifies on hover.  The internal content is initially hidden, then revealed via a height transition.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Subtle lift on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.5s ease; /* Smooth height transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  height: 200px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some example text to demonstrate the expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when you hover over it, revealing more content.  No JavaScript is needed!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition` property:**  This property is crucial for creating the smooth animation. It specifies which CSS properties should transition and how (duration, timing function).  We apply it to `box-shadow`, `transform` (for the lift on hover) and the `height` of the `.card-content`.\n* **`height` property:** The `.card-content` initially has a smaller height. On hover, this height is increased, revealing the hidden text.  The `overflow: hidden;` prevents the content from overflowing before expansion.\n* **`box-shadow` property:** This creates the subtle shadow effect, which is enhanced on hover.\n* **`transform: translateY(-2px);`:** This creates a subtle lifting effect on hover, adding depth to the animation.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (various articles on animations and transitions):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
