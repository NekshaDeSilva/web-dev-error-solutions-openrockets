[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when integrating Video.js into a responsive web design is the player's height not adjusting correctly to maintain its aspect ratio.  This often results in the video appearing stretched, squashed, or with significant letterboxing/pillarboxing, especially on different screen sizes or orientations.  The issue usually stems from the player's dimensions not being dynamically recalculated to match the containing element's size.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis solution uses CSS and JavaScript to ensure the Video.js player maintains its aspect ratio regardless of its container's size.\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\n```html\n<div id=\"video-container\">\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\n         data-setup=\"{}\">\n    <source src=\"your-video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">\n      To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a\n      web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a>\n    </p>\n  </video>\n</div>\n```\n\n**2. CSS Styling (style.css or within `<style>` tags):**\n\n```css\n#video-container {\n  position: relative; /* Important for aspect ratio calculation */\n  width: 100%;\n  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */\n  height: 0; /* Ensures height is calculated based on padding-bottom */\n}\n\n#video-container video {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n**3. JavaScript (optional, for more dynamic control):**\n\nThis JavaScript is not strictly necessary if your aspect ratio is consistent. However,  it allows for more flexibility.\n\n```javascript\n// This is not needed if you use only css and fix aspect ratio in the css\n// This js code adds functionality for dynamic resize\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n  const videoContainer = document.getElementById('video-container');\n  const videoPlayer = videojs('my-video');\n\n  function resizeVideo() {\n    const containerWidth = videoContainer.offsetWidth;\n    const containerHeight = videoContainer.offsetHeight;\n    const aspectRatio = 16/9; // Adjust this for your desired aspect ratio\n    const newHeight = containerWidth / aspectRatio;\n    videoContainer.style.paddingBottom = (newHeight / containerWidth) * 100 + '%';\n\n  }\n\n  window.addEventListener('resize', resizeVideo);\n  resizeVideo(); //Initial resize\n});\n\n```\n\n\n**Remember to replace `\"your-video.mp4\"` with the actual path to your video file.**  The `padding-bottom` technique in CSS is crucial. It creates a fixed aspect ratio by dynamically adjusting the height based on the width of the container.  The `16:9` aspect ratio can be changed according to your video's dimensions.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe CSS approach uses the `padding-bottom` trick to maintain the aspect ratio.  By setting `padding-bottom` as a percentage of the container's width, the height is automatically calculated to maintain the desired proportions. The `position: relative` and `position: absolute` on the container and video respectively, ensure the video fills the entire calculated space without overflowing.\n\nThe optional JavaScript enhances this by dynamically recalculating the aspect ratio and resizing the video whenever the browser window is resized. This provides a smoother user experience on responsive layouts.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Video.js Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)\n* **Responsive Design Techniques:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_design)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
