[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when using `NextResponse.redirect` within Next.js Middleware:  correctly preserving query parameters during redirection.  Incorrectly handling these parameters can lead to unexpected behavior and broken functionality in your application.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nWhen redirecting users from middleware using `NextResponse.redirect`, simply passing the original URL often fails to preserve query parameters.  This results in the redirected page losing crucial contextual information passed through the URL.  For example, if a user navigates to `/products?category=electronics`, a redirect that doesn't preserve the `category` parameter will land them on the target page without filtering by electronics.\n\n**Code: Step-by-Step Fix**\n\nLet's say we have middleware that redirects all requests to `/products` to `/shop` while retaining any query parameters.  Here's how to correctly handle it:\n\n**Incorrect Approach (Loses Query Parameters):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/products') {\n    url.pathname = '/shop'\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Approach (Preserves Query Parameters):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone()\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/products') {\n    url.pathname = '/shop'\n    // Preserves query parameters\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/products', // Only match /products\n}\n\n```\n\nThe correction doesn't involve any explicit code change within the `middleware` function itself  because the `.clone()` method already handles query parameters by default. The critical point is to use `req.nextUrl.clone()` to create a new URL object, which automatically inherits the query parameters from the original request.  The `matcher` config ensures that the middleware only applies to the `/products` route, preventing unintended redirects.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `req.nextUrl` object represents the incoming URL.  Directly manipulating it can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `clone()` method creates a copy, allowing modifications without affecting the original object. When `NextResponse.redirect` is called with the cloned URL, all the original query parameters are automatically included in the redirection.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse.redirect API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse-redirect)\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUsing `req.nextUrl.clone()` is crucial for correctly handling query parameters within Next.js Middleware redirects.  This simple step prevents data loss and ensures a smooth user experience.  Always remember to utilize cloning techniques when manipulating URLs to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
