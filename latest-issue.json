[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when developing Discord bots using the discord.js library:  rate limiting errors, specifically the `DiscordAPIError: 429`.  This error signifies that your bot has made too many requests to the Discord API within a short period, exceeding the allowed rate limit.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `DiscordAPIError: 429` error in Discord.js indicates that your bot has sent requests to the Discord API faster than the allowed rate.  Discord implements rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of its service.  When your bot exceeds these limits, the API responds with a 429 error code, halting further requests until the rate limit resets.  This often manifests as commands or functionalities failing to execute.  The error response may also include details like the remaining time until the limit resets (`retry_after` property).\n\n## Code Example: Implementing Rate Limiting Handling\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle rate limits using `setTimeout` and promises to ensure your bot adheres to Discord's API limitations.  We'll implement a simple function to send messages with built-in rate limit handling.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\n// Function to send a message with rate limit handling\nasync function sendMessageWithRateLimit(channel, message) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    try {\n      channel.send(message).then(resolve).catch(error => {\n        if (error.code === 50013) {  // Missing Permissions\n          reject(\"Missing Permissions\");\n        }\n        else if (error.code === 429) { //Rate Limit Hit\n          const retryAfter = error.response.headers['retry-after'];\n          console.warn(`Rate limit hit. Retrying after ${retryAfter}ms...`);\n          setTimeout(() => {\n             channel.send(message).then(resolve).catch(reject);\n          }, retryAfter);\n        } else {\n          reject(error); //Other Errors\n        }\n      });\n    } catch (error) {\n      reject(error); // Catch any errors outside then/catch block.\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('messageCreate', async msg => {\n  if (msg.content === '!test') {\n    try {\n      await sendMessageWithRateLimit(msg.channel, 'This message was sent with rate limit handling!');\n      console.log(\"Message sent successfully!\");\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error sending message:\", error);\n      // Add appropriate error handling here, like notifying the user or logging the error to a file\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); //Replace with your token\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `sendMessageWithRateLimit` function utilizes promises to handle asynchronous operations and error handling cleanly.\n\n1. **Promise Creation:** A Promise is created to manage the asynchronous `channel.send` operation.\n2. **Error Handling:** The `.catch` block handles potential errors.\n3. **Rate Limit Detection:** The code specifically checks for the `429` error code.\n4. **Retry Mechanism:** If a 429 error occurs, the `retry-after` header from the response (which specifies the time in milliseconds to wait) is extracted.  `setTimeout` then delays the message sending by this duration.\n5. **Recursive Retry:** The `channel.send(message)` is called again after the delay. This creates a recursive retry mechanism, making sure the message is sent eventually once the rate limit is lifted.\n6. **Missing Permissions check:**  The code also checks for the error code 50013 (missing permissions), to allow different error handling in those situations. This improves the robustness of the function.\n7. **Other Error Handling:** The `else` statement in the catch block ensures that other errors will not be caught and handled incorrectly.\n8. **Client and Event Listener:** The standard discord.js bot setup is included, with an event listener for messages and a function that calls `sendMessageWithRateLimit`.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Documentation:** [https://discord.js.org/](https://discord.js.org/)  (Check for the latest API reference)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:** (Discord's official documentation on rate limits is usually not publicly available in a single, consolidated place, but can be found within their developer portal if you are registered)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
