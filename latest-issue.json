[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware:  `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`. This error arises because the `Request` object, crucial for middleware functionality, isn't accessible in all contexts.  Middleware functions operate on incoming requests, and attempting to access `Request` outside the appropriate middleware function will lead to this error.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `ReferenceError: Request is not defined` error in Next.js Middleware signifies that you're trying to use the `Request` object (or associated methods like `Request.method`, `Request.headers`, etc.) within a code segment where it's not available. This commonly happens when you accidentally try to use middleware logic within a regular component, API route, or other parts of your application that don't have access to the incoming request context.\n\n\n**Code Example and Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's say you have a middleware function intended to redirect users based on their authentication status.  Incorrect implementation might look like this:\n\n**Incorrect Code (Will throw the error):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Function to check authentication\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\n// pages/index.js\nimport { checkAuthentication } from './middleware'; //INCORRECT - Attempting to use middleware logic outside middleware\n\nexport default function Home() {\n    const isAuth = checkAuthentication(); //Throws the error because 'req' is not defined here.\n    return <h1>Home Page</h1>\n}\n\n//Incorrect helper function\nfunction checkAuthentication(req){\n    if(req){\n        //logic to check authentication\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n```\n\n**Correct Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req);\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction checkAuthentication(req){\n    //logic to check authentication using 'req' object - example\n    const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n    if(token){\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n// pages/login.js\n// ...Login Page logic...\n\n// pages/index.js\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>Home Page</h1>; // No authentication logic here\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code encapsulates the authentication logic entirely within the `middleware.js` file. The `checkAuthentication` function now correctly receives the `req` object as an argument within the middleware function. This ensures that the `Request` object is only accessed where it is properly defined and available. The `Home` component no longer attempts to access authentication logic; this is handled entirely by the middleware.\n\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  (Refer to this for detailed information on using Next.js middleware)\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) (Understanding the difference between API routes and middleware)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
