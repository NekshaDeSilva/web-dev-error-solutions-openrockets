[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers like Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) is the failure of charts to render correctly or at all.  This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should be, or a partially rendered chart with missing elements.  The root cause is typically IE11's limited support for certain Canvas features or inconsistencies in its JavaScript engine compared to modern browsers.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThis example focuses on ensuring compatibility with IE11 using a polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`, a function often used within CanvasJS's rendering process.  While this might not solve *all* IE11 related CanvasJS issues, it's a frequently effective first step.\n\n**1. Include the `requestAnimationFrame` polyfill:**\n\nYou need to include a polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame` if it's not already present in your project.  A simple and widely used one is available via CDN.  Add this `<script>` tag within the `<head>` of your HTML file, *before* including the CanvasJS script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raf/3.4.0/raf.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**2.  Include the CanvasJS library:**\n\nNext, include the CanvasJS library.  Make sure to use a CDN or a correctly downloaded version.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.canvasjs.com/latest/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**3. Your CanvasJS chart code:**\n\nThis is a basic example. Replace this with your actual chart creation code:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        animationEnabled: true,\n        title: {\n            text: \"IE11 Compatibility Test\"\n        },\n        data: [{\n            type: \"column\",\n            dataPoints: [\n                { x: 10, y: 71 },\n                { x: 20, y: 55 },\n                { x: 30, y: 50 },\n                { x: 40, y: 65 }\n            ]\n        }]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n}\n```\n\n**4.  HTML Container:**\n\nFinally, ensure you have a container element with the ID \"chartContainer\" in your HTML:\n\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 500px;\"></div>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `requestAnimationFrame` polyfill ensures consistent behavior across different browsers, including IE11.  This function is crucial for smooth animations and rendering within CanvasJS. By adding the polyfill *before* the CanvasJS script, you ensure that CanvasJS uses the consistent polyfill implementation even if the native `requestAnimationFrame` in IE11 behaves differently. This addresses a significant source of rendering issues in older browsers.  Other issues might require additional debugging or specific workarounds depending on the nature of the error and the chart configuration.\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Check their documentation for browser compatibility and troubleshooting)\n* **`requestAnimationFrame` Polyfill (raf.js):** [https://github.com/ngryman/raf](https://github.com/ngryman/raf) (Source code and information about the polyfill used)\n* **Internet Explorer Compatibility:** [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/) (Microsoft's documentation on Internet Explorer, though largely deprecated)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
