[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands to reveal more content when hovered over, providing a visually engaging user experience without the need for JavaScript. This example utilizes standard CSS3 properties.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe effect is achieved primarily using the `transition` property combined with the `:hover` pseudo-class and strategically adjusted padding and height.  The card initially displays a smaller height showing only a summary. On hover, the height expands to reveal the full content.  We also use a subtle box-shadow for visual enhancement.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows initial height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  padding: 15px;\n  width: 300px; /* Adjust as needed */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 250px; /* Height when hovered */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /* Prevents text from overflowing and causing jumps during transition */\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is a short summary of the card's content.  More details will be revealed upon hover.</p>\n    <p>This is some additional content that will only be visible when the card is expanded.</p>\n    <p>Further expansion to fully demonstrate the effect.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden;` prevents content from spilling beyond the initial height. `transition: height 0.3s ease;` ensures a smooth transition when the height changes.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This targets the card when the mouse hovers over it. The `height` is increased to reveal the full content.\n* **`.card-content`**: This class prevents abrupt jump or visual glitches during the expansion by preventing overflow.\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease;`**: This CSS property defines the animation for the height change.  `0.3s` is the duration and `ease` is the timing function.  Experiment with different durations and timing functions (e.g., `linear`, `ease-in-out`) to achieve the desired effect.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - :hover pseudo-class:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
