[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required!  The effect involves a card that expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll use pure CSS3 to achieve this.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to create the smooth expanding animation. The card's height is initially set to a smaller value. On hover, the height is transitioned to a larger value, revealing hidden content within.  We use `overflow: hidden` to keep the hidden content concealed until the card expands.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some extra content that is revealed when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>You can add as much content as you want here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden` is crucial for hiding the content that extends beyond the initial height.  The `transition` property defines a smooth animation for the height change on hover.\n\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles when the card is hovered over.  The `height` is increased to reveal the hidden content.\n\n* **`.card-content` & `.card-title`:** These classes style the content within the card for better readability and presentation.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:**  [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Selectors:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)\n\n\nThis simple example demonstrates the power of CSS for creating engaging interactive effects without resorting to JavaScript. You can customize this code further by adjusting colors, adding more content, and experimenting with different transition properties.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
