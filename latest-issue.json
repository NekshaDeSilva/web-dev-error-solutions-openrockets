[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `DiscordAPIError: Invalid Form Body` error in Discord.js typically arises when you attempt to make a request to the Discord API with malformed or missing data in the request body. This often happens when interacting with endpoints that require specific data structures, such as creating messages with embeds, sending files, or updating guild settings.  The error message itself is usually not very specific, making debugging challenging.\n\n## Code: Step-by-Step Fix\n\nThis example focuses on a common scenario: sending an embed that is improperly formatted.  Let's assume you're trying to send a rich embed with missing required fields.\n\n**Incorrect Code (leading to the error):**\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField, EmbedBuilder } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n  const embed = new EmbedBuilder(); // Missing title and description!\n  client.channels.cache.get('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID').send({ embeds: [embed] });\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField, EmbedBuilder } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds, IntentsBitField.Flags.GuildMessages] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n  const embed = new EmbedBuilder()\n    .setTitle('My Embed Title')\n    .setDescription('This is the description of my embed.'); // Added title and description\n\n  client.channels.cache.get('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID').send({ embeds: [embed] });\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe original code created an empty `EmbedBuilder` object. The Discord API requires at least a title or description for a rich embed. The corrected code adds a title and description using the `setTitle()` and `setDescription()` methods, providing the necessary data for a valid request body.  Without this data, the API rejects the request, resulting in the `Invalid Form Body` error.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Guide:** [https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) (General documentation, helpful for understanding API interactions)\n* **Discord API Documentation:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#create-message](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#create-message) (Specific documentation for creating messages, including embed details)\n\n\n## Explanation of the Error and its Causes\n\nThe \"Invalid Form Body\" error is a broad error that indicates a problem with the structure or content of the data being sent to the Discord API.  In the context of embeds, it means the embed object you're sending is not conforming to the expected format.  Other common causes include:\n\n* **Missing required fields:**  As seen in the example, embeds and other API requests often require certain fields. Missing these will lead to this error.\n* **Incorrect data types:** Sending data in the wrong format (e.g., a string where a number is expected).\n* **Exceeding character limits:** Embeds and messages have length restrictions.\n* **Incorrect JSON structure:** If you're manually crafting JSON, ensure it's valid and correctly formatted.\n* **Rate limits:**  If you're sending requests too quickly, you might hit rate limits, which can manifest as this error.\n\nAlways carefully review the Discord API documentation for the specific endpoint you're using to ensure you're sending the correct data in the expected format.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
