[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect utilizes CSS transitions and transforms to create a smooth and visually appealing animation when a card is hovered over.  We'll be using plain CSS3 for this example, making it highly compatible across browsers.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts in a compact state.  Upon hovering, it smoothly expands horizontally, revealing more content.  This is achieved using CSS transitions on `transform: scaleX()` and `box-shadow`.  A subtle box shadow is added to enhance the three-dimensional effect. The expansion is confined to the horizontal axis to maintain a clean and focused animation.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scaleX(1.2); /* Expand horizontally */\n  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Increased shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  color: #333;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    This is some sample text inside the card.  It will expand horizontally on hover.\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the base card.  `transition` property is key; it defines smooth transitions for `transform` and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `transform: scaleX(1.2)` expands the card horizontally by 20% (`1.2 * original width`).  The `box-shadow` is increased to provide a more pronounced visual effect.\n* **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content within the card.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This is crucial for preventing content from overflowing during the expansion, keeping the effect clean.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Tricks (website):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) - A great resource for CSS tutorials and techniques.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
