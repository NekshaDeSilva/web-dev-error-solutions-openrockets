[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: Middleware response must not contain a 'body' property`.  This error arises when attempting to directly send a response body from middleware, which is not supported. Middleware's primary purpose is to modify the request or redirect, not to generate a full response.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error `Error: Middleware response must not contain a 'body' property` signifies that your middleware function is trying to return a response object that includes a `body` property.  Middleware functions should only utilize the `NextResponse` object's methods for redirection (`redirect()`), rewriting URLs (`rewrite()`), or modifying headers.  Attempting to set a body directly will result in this error.\n\n## Code: Problematic and Corrected Examples\n\n**Problematic Code (Incorrect):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Hello from middleware!' }) //INCORRECT\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about',\n}\n```\n\nThis code attempts to send a JSON response directly from the middleware. This will result in the error.\n\n\n**Corrected Code (Step-by-Step Fix):**\n\nThis example demonstrates redirecting to a different page if the condition is met, handling the situation correctly.  No response body is needed.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  // Simulate checking for a condition. Replace with your actual logic.\n  const isAuthenticated = false;\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    // Redirect to the login page if not authenticated.\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  //Otherwise, continue with request.\n  return NextResponse.next();\n\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about',\n}\n\n```\n\n**Corrected Code (Another Example using Headers):**\n\nThis example shows how to modify headers within middleware.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'My Custom Value');\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\nThis modifies the request's headers.  No body is included.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nNext.js Middleware is designed for handling requests *before* they reach your pages or API routes.  Its primary function is to transform requests, not to generate responses.  Therefore, directly adding a `body` to the response object within middleware is invalid and leads to the error.  Middleware should utilize `NextResponse.redirect()`, `NextResponse.rewrite()`, and header manipulation to control request flow.  Full responses are handled within your pages or API routes.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) (Refer to the section on `NextResponse` for further details.)\n* **NextResponse API Reference:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server/next-response) (Check the methods available and their usage.)\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
