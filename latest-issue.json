[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll use pure CSS3 for this, avoiding JavaScript entirely.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis effect relies primarily on the CSS `max-height` property and transitions.  The card starts with a limited `max-height`, visually restricting its content. On hover, the `max-height` is changed to allow the content to fully expand, and the transition property smoothly animates this change.  We also use some basic styling for visual appeal.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows the max-height */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 400px; /* Height when hovered */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some sample text for the card.  This content will be hidden initially and will expand on hover.</p>\n    <p>More text to demonstrate the expansion.  Add as much text as you need to see the effect clearly.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the overall card.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent the content from overflowing before the expansion. The `transition` property is what enables the smooth animation. `max-height: 100px;` sets the initial, collapsed height.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the inner content of the card for better visual presentation. You can customize these to your needs.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS max-height:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-height)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS Resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
