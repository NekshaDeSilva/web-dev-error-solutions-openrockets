[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The animation smoothly reveals the card content upon hover, providing a subtle and engaging user experience.  This example uses pure CSS3, avoiding the need for JavaScript libraries or frameworks.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis design features a card that initially displays only a minimal title and image. On hover, the card expands vertically, revealing hidden content (in this example, some descriptive text).  The animation utilizes CSS transitions for a smooth effect. The styling incorporates a subtle shadow for depth and visual appeal.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the initial height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-image {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-size: cover;\n  background-position: center;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for opacity change */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Reveal on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-image\" style=\"background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/300x100');\"></div>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">My Expanding Card</h3>\n    <p>This is some descriptive text about the card.  You can add as much content as you like here.  The card will expand to accommodate it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`.card`:**  This class styles the overall card container.  The `overflow: hidden;` is crucial for initially hiding the content that extends beyond the initial height.  The `transition` property defines the animation for the height change.\n*   **`.card:hover`:** This selector applies styles when the card is hovered over, expanding the height.\n*   **`.card-image`:** Styles the background image within the card.  You'll need to replace the placeholder image URL with your own.\n*   **`.card-content`:**  Styles the content area.  The initial `opacity: 0;` hides it, and the `transition` provides a smooth fade-in effect.\n*   **`.card:hover .card-content`:**  This selector targets the content area *only* when the card is hovered over, revealing it.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n*   [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - MDN documentation on CSS transitions.\n*   [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) - MDN documentation on CSS selectors (understanding `:hover`).\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
