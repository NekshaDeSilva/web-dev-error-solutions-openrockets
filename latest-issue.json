[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the `Response already sent` error. This error typically arises when you attempt to modify the response object multiple times within the same middleware function, leading to conflicts and preventing Next.js from correctly serving the request.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Response already sent` error in Next.js Middleware signifies that a response has already been committed to the client before your middleware function attempted to further modify it.  This often happens when you have multiple `res.redirect()` calls, multiple `res.end()` calls, or a combination of both within a single middleware function, or when combining middleware with other response-modifying methods.  The browser receives the initial response, and any subsequent attempts to change it are ignored, resulting in this error.\n\n\n**Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\nLet's consider a scenario where we have middleware intended to redirect users to the `/login` page if they are not authenticated.  The flawed implementation might look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    // Incorrect: This will cause 'Response already sent' error if other modifications are attempted later.\n    res.redirect('/login') \n    //Other logic that might throw error\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/', //this matcher specifies that this middleware will run on the root path only.\n};\n```\n\n**Step 1: Identify Conflicting Response Modifications:**\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that the middleware attempts to perform other operations after `res.redirect('/login')`.  This creates the conflict.\n\n\n**Step 2: Use `NextResponse` consistently:**\n\nThe correct approach involves using `NextResponse` consistently for all response manipulations within the middleware function.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n\n**Step 3: Employ Conditional Logic Effectively:**\n\nEnsure that only one response modification occurs.  Use `if` statements or other control flow mechanisms to ensure that you only execute a single `NextResponse` method per middleware function execution.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `NextResponse` object provides methods for creating and modifying responses in a controlled manner.  Using `NextResponse.redirect()` returns a proper response object; whereas `res.redirect()` operates directly on the underlying response object and is incompatible with other modifications within a middleware function.  The `new URL('/login', req.url)` creates a correctly formatted URL object to ensure that the redirect works properly with different request paths.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js `NextResponse` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
