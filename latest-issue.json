[{"body":"\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nDevelopers often encounter rendering problems with CanvasJS charts in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11).  IE11's older rendering engine may struggle with modern CanvasJS features or lack support for certain CSS properties used by the chart library. This can manifest as blank charts, incompletely rendered elements, or incorrect chart layout.  The error might not be explicitly reported as a JavaScript error, making debugging challenging.\n\n**Code Fix (Step-by-Step):**\n\nThis example assumes you're using a basic column chart.  Adapt the code to fit your specific chart configuration.\n\n**1.  Ensure Compatibility Mode is Disabled (If Applicable):**\n\nIE11's compatibility modes can interfere with modern web technologies.  Ensure that your website isn't being rendered in compatibility mode. Check your browser settings or use the developer tools to verify the rendering mode.  The exact method varies slightly depending on the IE11 version.\n\n\n**2.  Include Necessary Polyfills:**\n\nIE11 lacks support for some ECMAScript features used by CanvasJS.  Include polyfills to provide compatibility.  Consider using a library like `core-js` to add missing functionality.\n\n```html\n<!-- ... other head elements ... -->\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/client/core.js\"></script>  <!-- Or a suitable CDN -->\n<!-- ... rest of your head elements ... -->\n```\n\n\n**3.  Check for CSS Conflicts:**\n\nConflicts between your site's CSS and CanvasJS's default styles can lead to rendering issues.  Try these steps:\n\n* **Inspect the chart element:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the chart's container element. Look for unexpected styles that might be overriding CanvasJS's styles.\n* **Add a unique class:** Give your chart container a unique class and style it separately to isolate it from any potential conflicts.\n\n\n**4.  Simplify Chart Configuration:**\n\nStart with a minimal chart configuration to rule out complex data or options as the cause. If a simplified chart renders correctly, gradually add complexity to pinpoint the problematic configuration element.\n\n\n**5. Use CanvasJS's Excanvas for IE8 and below (if still needed):**\n\nWhile less likely with modern IE11, if you *must* support older browsers, CanvasJS might need Excanvas. This is generally not necessary for IE11, but if other issues persist and you support older browsers, consider this:\n\n**Note:** Excanvas is deprecated and support for IE8 and below is generally not recommended.\n\n```html\n<!-- Ideally, avoid using Excanvas for IE11 -->\n<!--[if lte IE 8]><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"excanvas.js\"></script><![endif]--> \n```\n\n\n**6. Update CanvasJS:**\n\nEnsure you are using the latest version of the CanvasJS library. Newer versions often include bug fixes and compatibility improvements.  Check the CanvasJS official website for updates.\n\n\n\n**Example Code Snippet (with fixes):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/client/core.js\"></script> \n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n<title>CanvasJS Chart</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n  var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    title:{\n      text: \"Simple Column Chart\"\n    },\n    data: [\n    {\n      type: \"column\",\n      dataPoints: [\n        { label: \"Apple\",  y: 10  },\n        { label: \"Orange\", y: 15  },\n        { label: \"Banana\", y: 25  }\n      ]\n    }\n    ]\n  });\n  chart.render();\n}\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **CanvasJS Official Website:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/)  (Check for documentation and support)\n* **Core-js (Polyfills):** [https://github.com/zloirock/core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)\n* **MDN Web Docs (IE11):** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Internet_Explorer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Internet_Explorer) (For browser compatibility information)\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe steps outlined above address common causes of CanvasJS rendering issues in IE11.  By addressing compatibility issues (polyfills, CSS conflicts), simplifying the chart configuration, and ensuring the latest version of the library is used, you significantly improve the chances of successful rendering.  Remember to always test thoroughly in IE11 using its developer tools to pinpoint and resolve any remaining problems.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
