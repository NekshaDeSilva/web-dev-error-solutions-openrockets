[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content. This example utilizes plain CSS3; no JavaScript or frameworks like Tailwind are needed.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe styling uses a combination of CSS transitions and pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`) to achieve the expanding effect. The card's initial height is set to be smaller than its content. On hover, the height transitions to accommodate the full content, creating a smooth expansion.  A subtle background color change is also included for visual feedback.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflowing content initially */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  position: relative; /* Needed for absolute positioning of pseudo-elements */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  background-color: #e0e0e0;\n  height: auto; /* Expand to full content height on hover */\n}\n\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card::before, .card::after {\n    content: '';\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n    opacity: 0;\n    transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover::before, .card:hover::after {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3>This is the card title</h3>\n    <p>This is some example text that will be hidden initially and revealed when the card is hovered over.</p>\n    <p>More text to ensure the card expands significantly.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line is crucial for the smooth expansion. It specifies that the `height` property should transition over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`height: auto;`**: On hover, the `height` is set to `auto`, allowing the card to naturally expand to fit its content.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the content from overflowing the initial smaller height before the hover effect.\n* **Pseudo-elements:** The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to create a subtle darkening effect when hovered over for better visual feedback. You can customize this further or remove them if preferred.\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - Pseudo-elements:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** Search for \"CSS transitions\" or \"CSS hover effects\" on [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) for more advanced techniques.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
