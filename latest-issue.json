[{"body":"\nThis document details a common problem developers face in MongoDB: the \"Index not found\" error during CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, specifically focusing on the read operations.  This error occurs when a query attempts to utilize an index that doesn't exist or isn't correctly configured.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe \"Index not found\" error manifests when a query optimized for a specific index fails because that index is absent or improperly defined. This results in MongoDB performing a collection scan, drastically slowing down queries, especially on large datasets.  The error message might not always explicitly state \"Index not found,\" but it will usually indicate slow query performance significantly exceeding what's expected with an appropriate index.  You'll likely see significantly increased query execution times in your logs or monitoring tools.\n\n\n## Scenario: Slow Queries on a Large Collection\n\nLet's imagine we have a collection named `products` with millions of documents, each containing fields like `name` (string), `category` (string), and `price` (number).  We want to efficiently find all products in a specific category, e.g., \"Electronics\".  Without an index on the `category` field, the query will be extremely slow.\n\n## Code: Fixing the Problem Step by Step\n\n**1. Identify the Slow Query:**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the query causing the performance issue. MongoDB's profiling tools (or your monitoring system) can help pinpoint which queries are taking excessively long.\n\n\n**2. Check Existing Indexes:**\n\nLet's use the `db.products.getIndexes()` command to see if an index exists on the `category` field:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.getIndexes()\n```\n\nThis will output a list of existing indexes. If you don't see an index containing `category` with the desired sort order, you need to create one.\n\n\n**3. Create the Index:**\n\nWe'll create a compound index on `category` to speed up queries filtering by category.  A compound index can include multiple fields, which can be beneficial for more complex queries:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.createIndex( { category: 1 } )\n```\n\nThis command creates an ascending index (indicated by `1`) on the `category` field. For descending index use `-1`.  Consider adding other fields if your queries often involve combining `category` with other fields for filtering, e.g.,  `db.products.createIndex( { category: 1, price: -1 } )`.\n\n\n**4. Verify Index Creation:**\n\nAfter creating the index, re-run `db.products.getIndexes()` to confirm it was successfully added. You should now see the new index in the output.\n\n\n**5. Re-run the Query:**\n\nNow, re-run your query that previously caused the slow performance.  The query should now execute significantly faster due to the index.\n\n\n**Example Query:**\n\nThis query retrieves products in the \"Electronics\" category.  It's significantly faster with an index on `category`:\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.find({ category: \"Electronics\" })\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nIndexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They are special data structures that speed up data retrieval by creating a sorted order of the values of one or more fields.  Without indexes, MongoDB has to scan the entire collection to find matching documents, which is slow for large datasets. When an index exists, MongoDB can quickly locate documents based on the indexed fields, drastically improving query performance.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **MongoDB Documentation on Indexes:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* **MongoDB Performance Tuning:** [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/optimize-query-performance/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/optimize-query-performance/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
