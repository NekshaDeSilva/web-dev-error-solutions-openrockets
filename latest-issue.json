[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware: `Error: Middleware responses must not contain a 'set-cookie' header`.  This error arises because Middleware is designed for modifying requests *before* they reach the page or API route, not for directly setting cookies.  Cookies should be set within the API routes themselves.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `Error: Middleware responses must not contain a 'set-cookie' header` occurs when your Next.js Middleware attempts to set a cookie using `setHeader` or a similar method.  Middleware's primary purpose is to intercept and potentially redirect requests, add headers for caching or security, or perform other pre-rendering tasks.  It's not meant for managing session state through cookies.  Attempting to do so results in this error.\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.next();\n  res.headers.set('Set-Cookie', 'user=john; Path=/'); // INCORRECT - This causes the error\n  return res;\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Move Cookie Setting to an API Route:** Instead of trying to set the cookie in the Middleware, create (or use an existing) API route.\n\n2. **API Route Implementation:** This API route will handle setting the cookie.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/set-cookie.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const res = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Cookie set successfully' });\n  res.cookies.set('user', 'john', { path: '/' }); // CORRECT - Set cookie in API route\n  return res;\n}\n```\n\n3. **Call API Route from your Frontend:**  You'll need to make a request (e.g., using `fetch`) to your API route from your client-side Next.js application to trigger cookie setting.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/index.js\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch('/api/set-cookie', { method: 'POST' });\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Hello!</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n4. **Remove Cookie Setting from Middleware:**  Completely remove the `res.headers.set('Set-Cookie', ...)` line from your Middleware file.  Your Middleware file should now focus solely on request modification tasks that don't involve setting cookies.\n\n\n**Corrected Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  // Add other middleware logic here, but NO cookie setting!\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMiddleware operates in a distinct phase of the request lifecycle from API routes. Middleware acts as a pre-processing stage for requests, while API routes handle data interactions and responses, including cookie management. Setting cookies is part of the response handling that's properly managed in API routes.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [NextResponse Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
