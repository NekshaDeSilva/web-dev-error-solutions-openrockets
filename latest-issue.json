[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object`.  This error occurs when your middleware function doesn't return a valid `Response` object, preventing the middleware from properly handling requests.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error message `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object` explicitly states the problem.  Your middleware function, designed to intercept and modify requests before they reach the page component or API route, isn't returning an object of the type `Response`. This is crucial because Next.js relies on the `Response` object to understand how to handle the request (e.g., redirecting, setting headers, modifying the response body).  The middleware will fail if it returns `undefined`, `null`, a plain JavaScript object, or a promise that doesn't resolve to a `Response` object.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's assume you have a middleware function that attempts to redirect based on authentication status:\n\n**Incorrect Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return { redirect: { destination: '/login', permanent: false } }; // INCORRECT!\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code is flawed because it returns a plain JavaScript object instead of a `Response` object.  This will result in the error.\n\n**Corrected Middleware:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = checkAuthentication(req); // Your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next(); // Continue to the original request\n}\n\n\n//Helper function (replace with your actual authentication logic)\nfunction checkAuthentication(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token'); //Example - Replace with your token retrieval\n  return !!token; //Return true if token exists, false otherwise\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected version utilizes `NextResponse` from `next/server`. This object provides methods for creating valid `Response` objects.  `NextResponse.redirect()` creates a redirect response, and `NextResponse.next()` allows the request to proceed to the intended destination.  Crucially, we're using `new URL('/login', req.url)` to construct a properly formatted URL for the redirect, ensuring it's relative to the original request's URL.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/middleware)  (Check for the most updated documentation as it frequently changes)\n* **NextResponse API Reference:**  (You'll find this within the Next.js documentation linked above.  Look for the section on `NextResponse`.)\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe key to avoiding the `Error: Middleware response is not a Response object` is to always return a valid `Response` object from your middleware function.  Use `NextResponse` to create these responses, ensuring your middleware behaves as intended.  Remember to handle both success and failure scenarios (e.g., redirection vs. continuing the request).\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
