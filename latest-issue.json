[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card using only CSS. The card expands smoothly when hovered over, revealing additional content.  We'll utilize CSS transitions and transforms for a clean, elegant effect.  This example uses plain CSS, but could easily be adapted to a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts collapsed. On hover, the card's height expands, and the hidden content smoothly slides into view. We use a `transform: scale()` to add a subtle \"pop\" effect during the expansion. A subtle box shadow is added to enhance the 3D appearance.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the initial height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 200px; /* Height on hover */\n  transform: scale(1.02); /* Subtle scaling effect */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n.card-content h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.hidden-content {\n  height: 100px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;\n  max-height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n}\n\n\n.card:hover .hidden-content {\n  max-height: 100px; /* Show on hover */\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some visible content.</p>\n    <div class=\"hidden-content\">\n      <p>This is the hidden content that appears on hover.</p>\n      <p>More hidden content here.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the smooth animation.  It specifies that the `height` and `transform` properties should transition over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function.\n* **`height` property:** Controls the initial and expanded height of the card.\n* **`transform: scale(1.02)`:** This adds a slight zoom effect on hover, making the expansion feel more dynamic.\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** Prevents content from spilling outside the card's boundaries.\n* **`max-height` property and `.hidden-content`:**  This is used in conjunction with the transition to smoothly reveal and hide the additional content.  The `max-height` is initially 0, and then expands to reveal the content on hover.\n\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** (Search for \"CSS transitions\" or \"CSS animations\" on their website for many tutorials) [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
