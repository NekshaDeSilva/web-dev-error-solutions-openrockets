[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when using CanvasJS charts in older browsers, particularly Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), is the failure of charts to render correctly or at all. This often manifests as a blank space where the chart should appear, or as a partially rendered chart with missing elements. This is due to IE11's limited support for modern JavaScript features and Canvas rendering capabilities.  While CanvasJS generally aims for broad browser compatibility, IE11 often requires specific workarounds.\n\n## Code to Fix the Problem (Step-by-Step)\n\nThis example assumes you're already including the CanvasJS library correctly in your HTML. The core issue is often inadequate polyfills for missing features.\n\n**Step 1: Include necessary polyfills**\n\nIE11 lacks support for certain `Array` methods and other features.  We'll use a polyfill library like `core-js` to address this. Add the following `<script>` tag in your HTML's `<head>` section, *before* including the CanvasJS script:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.array.find.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.array.includes.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.object.assign.js\"></script>\n<!-- Add other necessary polyfills as needed -->\n```\n\nThese specific polyfills address `Array.find()`, `Array.includes()`, and `Object.assign()`, which are commonly used by CanvasJS internally.  You might need to include more depending on the specific error messages you encounter. Check the CanvasJS documentation (see below) and browser developer console for clues on missing features.\n\n**Step 2: Ensure Correct CanvasJS Inclusion**\n\nMake sure you have correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML, preferably after the polyfills:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nReplace this with the actual path to your CanvasJS library if you're not using a CDN.\n\n**Step 3:  Minimal Example and Chart Creation**\n\nHere's a minimal example demonstrating chart creation:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<HTML>\n<HEAD>\n<title>CanvasJS IE11 Fix</title>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.array.find.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.array.includes.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/core-js@3/modules/es.object.assign.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n</HEAD>\n<BODY>\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function () {\n    var chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n        data: [{\n            type: \"column\",\n            dataPoints: [\n                { x: 10, y: 71 },\n                { x: 20, y: 55 },\n                { x: 30, y: 50 },\n                { x: 40, y: 65 }\n            ]\n        }]\n    });\n    chart.render();\n}\n</script>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n```\n\nThis example creates a simple column chart.  Replace this data with your own.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nIE11's lack of native support for modern JavaScript features used by CanvasJS leads to rendering failures.  The polyfills provide backward compatibility, allowing CanvasJS to function correctly.  By including the appropriate polyfills *before* the CanvasJS script, we ensure that the necessary functions are available when CanvasJS attempts to use them.  The exact polyfills needed may vary depending on the specific CanvasJS version and your chart configuration.  Consult the browser's developer console for clues if you encounter further errors.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Check their documentation for browser compatibility information and potential workarounds)\n* **core-js Documentation:** [https://github.com/zloirock/core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) (For information on available polyfills)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
