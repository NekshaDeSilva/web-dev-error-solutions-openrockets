[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is needed! This effect uses CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly expand a card when it's hovered over.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThis technique utilizes the `:hover` pseudo-class to trigger a transformation on the card.  When the mouse hovers over the card, it expands in size and optionally reveals hidden content.  The key is leveraging CSS transitions to create a smooth animation.  We'll also employ some basic box-shadow styling for visual appeal.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out, box-shadow 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Added transition for smoother effect */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond card initially */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1);\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content beyond initial height */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Added transition for smoother effect */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  height: 200px; /* Height on hover */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.card p{\n  margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>Card Title</h2>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is some example text that will expand when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>More text here to demonstrate the expansion.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition` property:** This is crucial for the smooth animation.  We're transitioning the `transform` (for scaling) and `box-shadow` properties over 0.3 seconds with an ease-in-out timing function. We also transition the height of the `card-content` div.\n* **`transform: scale(1.1)`:** This increases the size of the card on hover by 10%.\n* **`box-shadow`:**  This adds a more pronounced shadow on hover to enhance the visual effect.\n* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** This selector targets the element when the mouse cursor is over it.\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** This ensures that content exceeding the initial height of the card is hidden before the hover effect.\n* The `card-content` div's height transition allows for a smooth expansion of the content upon hover.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (various articles on CSS animations and effects):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
