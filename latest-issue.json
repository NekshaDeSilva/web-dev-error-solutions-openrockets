[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when using Next.js Middleware, specifically when attempting to access locale information from the request object before it's properly populated.  This often happens when trying to redirect based on locale preferences early in the middleware chain.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')` arises when your middleware attempts to access `req.locale` or a similar property within the request object (`req`) before Next.js has fully processed the request and assigned the locale information. This typically occurs when the middleware runs too early in the pipeline, before Next.js's i18n (internationalization) features have had a chance to extract and set the locale.\n\n\n## Code and Fixing Steps\n\nLet's assume you have a middleware file (`middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`) aiming to redirect users to a specific locale based on their browser's preferred language:\n\n\n**Problematic Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (INCORRECT)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const locale = req.locale; // ERROR: req.locale might be undefined here!\n  if (locale === 'es') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))\n  }\n  // ...other logic...\n}\n```\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\nThis issue can be fixed by ensuring the `req.locale` is available. This often means waiting for the i18n pipeline to complete, or using the `NextRequest` object properly:\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js (CORRECTED)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl;\n  const locale = url.locale; // Access locale from NextRequest's nextUrl\n\n  if (locale === 'es') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url))\n  }\n  // ... other logic ...\n\n}\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the fix:**\n\nInstead of directly accessing `req.locale`, we now access the `locale` property from `req.nextUrl`.  The `req.nextUrl` object is properly populated with locale information at the point the middleware is invoked, even at earlier stages in the request processing pipeline. This method reliably retrieves the user's locale without encountering the `undefined` error.\n\n\nThe `config.matcher` ensures the middleware does not interfere with static assets or API routes.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware): The official Next.js documentation on Middleware.\n* [Next.js Internationalization (i18n) Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/i18n-internationalization): The official Next.js documentation on i18n.\n* [Next.js Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/routing): NextJS Routing Documentation.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe core problem lies in the timing of accessing the `req.locale`.  Middleware runs *before* Next.js has completely processed the request and assigned the locale.  By using `req.nextUrl.locale`, we access the locale information after it has been correctly assigned by the Next.js routing system, thereby avoiding the `undefined` error.  Using `config.matcher` correctly prevents the middleware from being unnecessarily applied to routes and file paths which are not pertinent to the context of the error.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
