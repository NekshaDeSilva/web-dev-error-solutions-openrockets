[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  This effect creates a visually appealing and interactive element without relying on JavaScript.  We'll leverage CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth and engaging animation.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a compact state, displaying only a title and a small preview image. Upon hovering, the card expands smoothly, revealing additional content (in this example, some text) below.  The expansion is accompanied by a subtle scaling effect for added visual appeal.  We use only CSS for the entire animation, making it lightweight and performant.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out, transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height and transform */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Increased height on hover */\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Subtle scaling effect */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-image {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100px;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  display: none; /* Initially hidden */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-text {\n  display: block; /* Shown on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x100\" alt=\"Placeholder Image\" class=\"card-image\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h3>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some additional text that will be revealed when the card is hovered over.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition` Property:** This property is key to the animation. It defines the properties (`height`, `transform`) that will smoothly transition over `0.3s` using an `ease-in-out` timing function.  This provides a natural and pleasing animation.\n* **`transform: scale(1.05)`:** This subtly scales the card up on hover, enhancing the visual feedback.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the content from overflowing the initial card boundaries before the expansion.\n* **`display: none;` and `display: block;`:** These control the visibility of the extra text, showing it only when the card is hovered over.\n* **`flex-direction: column;`:** This arranges the image and title vertically within the card.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
