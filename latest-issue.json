[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error developers encounter when attempting to import modules from `next/server` within Next.js API routes.  The error typically manifests as a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` or a similar error related to importing modules designed for the server-side rendering context into an API route which is already running in that context.  This happens because API routes, unlike pages,  already have access to the server-side runtime environment.  Trying to explicitly import `next/server` modules makes them inaccessible.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe core problem lies in a misunderstanding of the Next.js runtime environment.  API routes operate within the Node.js environment directly, granting access to the `request` and `response` objects.  They don't need the `next/server` APIs to manipulate the request or response. Importing functions like `redirect` or `NextResponse` from `next/server` within an API route results in an error because those functions are specifically designed for the page rendering context (middleware or pages), not the API context.  In effect, it is double-importing server-side functionality.\n\n## Fixing the Error: Step-by-Step Code\n\nLet's illustrate with a common scenario:  redirecting based on API route logic. The incorrect approach attempts to use `NextResponse.redirect` within the API Route.\n\n**Incorrect Code (Throws Error):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/redirect.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.url));  //Error: Cannot use import statement outside a module\n  }\n  res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/redirect.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    res.redirect('/dashboard');\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).end(); // Method Not Allowed\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version utilizes the built-in `res.redirect()` method provided by the Node.js `http` module, which is directly available within the API route context.  It achieves the same redirection functionality without any unnecessary imports.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key difference lies in how Next.js handles pages and API routes. Pages utilize the `next/server` module to manage rendering, routing, and responses, especially during the server-side phase. API routes, however, directly interact with the Node.js `http` module (or `https` depending on the setup) to handle requests and responses. They're simpler and don't need the extra abstraction layer provided by `next/server`. Trying to force `next/server` imports into API routes creates a conflict.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) -  Official documentation for Next.js API routes.\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - For understanding the context of `next/server` usage.\n* **Node.js `http` Module Documentation:** [https://nodejs.org/api/http.html](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) - To understand the underlying HTTP handling capabilities.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
