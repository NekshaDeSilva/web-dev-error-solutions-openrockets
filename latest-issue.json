[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS. No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that expands on hover, revealing hidden content with a smooth, subtle animation. We'll utilize CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is designed with a simple, clean aesthetic.  The hidden content is initially hidden using `max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;`. On hover, the `max-height` is set to a larger value, allowing the content to expand. The transition property smoothly animates this change.  A subtle box-shadow enhances the 3D effect. We also add a simple background color and some padding for better readability.  \n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /*Added transform transition for smoother effect*/\n  overflow: hidden; /* Ensure content stays within the card boundaries even when expanding */\n  width: 300px; /* Added width for better visual effect */\n  \n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  transform: translateY(-2px); /* Added a subtle lift on hover */\n}\n\n\n.card-content {\n  max-height: 0; /*Initially hidden*/\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height 0.5s ease-out; /*Added ease-out for smoother transition*/\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  max-height: 200px; /*Adjust as needed*/\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>Card Title</h2>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is some hidden content that will reveal itself on hover.  You can add as much text as you need here.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.  Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease;`**: This line applies smooth transitions to the `box-shadow` and `transform` properties, making the hover effect more visually appealing.  The `ease` timing function provides a natural-feeling animation.\n\n* **`max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;`**:  This hides the content initially.\n\n* **`transition: max-height 0.5s ease-out;`**: This smoothly animates the change in `max-height` when the card is hovered over. The `ease-out` timing function makes the animation slower at the end, giving it a more natural feel.\n\n* **`max-height: 200px;`**: This determines the maximum height the content can expand to. Adjust this value as needed.\n\n* **`transform: translateY(-2px);`**: This subtly lifts the card on hover, adding a further enhancement to the visual effect.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** (Search for \"CSS animations\" or \"CSS transitions\" on their site for numerous tutorials)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
