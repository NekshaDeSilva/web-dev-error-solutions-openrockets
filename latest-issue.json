[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common issue when working with Next.js API routes is exceeding the default request timeout or encountering issues handling large response sizes.  This manifests as a 504 Gateway Timeout error on the client-side, or your API route simply hanging without returning a response. This is particularly problematic when dealing with operations that generate substantial data, like processing large files or performing complex database queries.\n\nThe default timeout in many serverless environments (like Vercel, which Next.js often deploys to) is relatively short. Exceeding this limit leads to the termination of your API route before it can complete its task and send a response.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you have an API route that processes a large CSV file and returns its contents. The following demonstrates the problem and its solution.\n\n\n**Problem Code (api/processCSV.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// api/processCSV.js\nimport fs from 'fs/promises';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const filePath = './large_file.csv'; // Replace with your file path\n  try {\n    const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    const csvData = data.split('\\n'); // Simple CSV parsing - replace with your preferred method\n    res.status(200).json({ data: csvData });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to process file' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code might fail if `large_file.csv` is very large or the parsing takes too long.\n\n**Solution Code (api/processCSV.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// api/processCSV.js\nimport fs from 'fs/promises';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const filePath = './large_file.csv'; // Replace with your file path\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); // Important for streaming\n  res.status(200); // Important for streaming\n  try {\n    const readStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let csvData = [];\n    let lineCount = 0;\n    readStream.on('data', chunk => {\n      const lines = chunk.split('\\n');\n      lines.forEach((line, index) => {\n        if (line.trim() !== \"\") { // Ignore empty lines\n            csvData.push(line);\n            lineCount++;\n        }\n        if (index === lines.length-1 && lines.length > 0) {\n            res.write(JSON.stringify({data: csvData, count: lineCount}));\n            csvData = [];\n            lineCount = 0;\n        }\n      });\n    });\n\n    readStream.on('end', () => {\n      res.end();\n    });\n\n    readStream.on('error', (error) => {\n      console.error(error);\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to process file' });\n      res.end();\n    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to process file' });\n    res.end();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis improved version uses streams (`fs.createReadStream`) to process the file chunk by chunk.  This prevents loading the entire file into memory at once.  It also sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` and starts sending the response immediately, with regular updates (after each chunk).  The response ends after the entire file is processed.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe original code attempted to read the entire file into memory before processing and sending the response. For large files, this leads to memory exhaustion and timeouts. The improved code utilizes streams, allowing the file to be processed and sent in smaller, manageable chunks. This significantly reduces memory usage and avoids exceeding the request timeout. The use of `res.write` allows for streaming the JSON response piece-by-piece.\n\n## External References\n\n* [Node.js `fs.createReadStream` documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fscreatereadstreampath-options)\n* [Next.js API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Vercel Serverless Functions Timeouts](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/limits#timeouts) (or your deployment platform's equivalent)\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
