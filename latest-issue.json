[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem encountered when integrating the Video.js HTML5 video player into responsive web designs: the player's size not adapting correctly to different screen sizes or window resizes.  The player may appear stretched, cropped, or too small. This often manifests as a mismatch between the player's aspect ratio and the container's aspect ratio.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe Video.js player, by default, doesn't automatically resize itself to perfectly fit its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.  If your container's dimensions change (due to a responsive design or window resize), the video may appear distorted or incorrectly sized.  The player might stretch to fill the container, losing its original aspect ratio, or it might remain at its initial size, leaving empty space around it.\n\n\n## Code Fix: Step-by-Step\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use CSS and JavaScript to ensure the Video.js player maintains its aspect ratio while resizing responsively within its container.\n\n**1. HTML Structure:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Responsive Video.js Player</title>\n<link href=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video-js.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<style>\n  .video-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n  }\n  .video-js {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n  <video id=\"my-video\" class=\"video-js\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" poster=\"poster.jpg\">\n    <source src=\"myvideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a></p>\n  </video>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://vjs.zencdn.net/7.20.3/video.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  var player = videojs('my-video');\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation of HTML:**\n\n*   We use a container (`video-container`) with a specific aspect ratio (16:9 in this case). The `padding-bottom` trick maintains the aspect ratio even when the container's width changes.\n*   The `video-js` class applies Video.js styling.\n*   The `video` element is positioned absolutely within the container, filling it completely.\n\n\n**2.  JavaScript (Optional - for advanced control):**\n\nWhile the CSS above handles most responsive scenarios, you might need JavaScript for more complex resizing logic or interaction with other elements.  For simple cases, it's not strictly necessary.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key to solving this problem is maintaining the aspect ratio.  The CSS solution uses the `padding-bottom` trick on the container.  By setting `padding-bottom` to a percentage representing the desired aspect ratio (e.g., 56.25% for 16:9), the container's height automatically adjusts proportionally to its width, ensuring the aspect ratio is preserved. The video player, positioned absolutely within this container, then fills the entire space.\n\n## External References\n\n*   **Video.js Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/)  (Refer to their documentation for the latest API and features)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
