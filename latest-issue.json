[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem when integrating CanvasJS charts into responsive web designs is the chart failing to render correctly or resizing properly as the browser window is resized. This often manifests as a chart that is either cut off, displays incorrectly scaled, or remains static despite changes in viewport dimensions.  The issue stems from a mismatch between the chart's container size and the available space, especially when using percentage-based widths and heights.  CanvasJS needs accurate dimensions to render properly.\n\n## Fixing Step-by-Step\n\nThis solution utilizes a combination of JavaScript and ensuring the chart's container has the correct dimensions before the chart is rendered.  We'll use a `window.addEventListener` to detect resize events.\n\n**Step 1:  Include CanvasJS:**\n\nFirst, ensure you've correctly included the CanvasJS library in your HTML file. You can download it from their official website:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nReplace `\"https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js\"` with the actual path to your downloaded file if necessary.\n\n\n**Step 2: HTML Structure:**\n\nCreate a container div to hold your chart.  Using a `div` with an `id` is crucial for CanvasJS to target it:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"chartContainer\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%;\"></div>\n```\n\n**Step 3: JavaScript Implementation:**\n\nThis JavaScript code will handle chart creation and resizing:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', function() {\n  renderChart();\n});\n\nfunction renderChart() {\n  //Get the container element.  We use querySelector to ensure we grab the element after any potential page re-rendering caused by a resize event.\n  const chartContainer = document.querySelector('#chartContainer');\n\n  // Get the container's updated dimensions after resize\n  const containerWidth = chartContainer.offsetWidth;\n  const containerHeight = chartContainer.offsetHeight;\n\n\n  // CanvasJS Chart Configuration.  Replace with your actual data.\n  const chartData = {\n    animationEnabled: true,\n    title: {\n      text: \"Responsive Chart\"\n    },\n    data: [{\n      type: \"column\",\n      dataPoints: [\n        { label: \"Apple\", y: 10 },\n        { label: \"Orange\", y: 15 },\n        { label: \"Banana\", y: 25 }\n      ]\n    }]\n  };\n\n  //Check if a chart already exists before creating a new one to prevent memory leaks.\n  if (window.chart){\n    window.chart.destroy();\n  }\n  // Create the chart, using the updated dimensions\n  window.chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n    height: containerHeight,\n    width: containerWidth,\n    ...chartData\n  });\n\n  window.chart.render();\n}\n\n// Initial chart render\nrenderChart();\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key improvements in this solution are:\n\n* **`window.addEventListener('resize', renderChart)`:** This ensures the chart is re-rendered whenever the browser window is resized.  The `renderChart` function is called on window resize.\n* **`offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight`:** These properties retrieve the *actual* rendered width and height of the `#chartContainer` div, accounting for any changes due to responsiveness.  This is crucial as using percentage-based height/width in CSS might not provide immediately-available values during initial page render.\n* **`chart.destroy()`:** This line ensures that if the chart already exists, it is destroyed before a new one is created. This prevents multiple charts from being rendered, which can lead to performance issues and memory leaks.\n* **Initial render call `renderChart()`:**  This ensures the chart is rendered when the page initially loads.\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Official Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/docs/](https://canvasjs.com/docs/)  (Refer to their documentation for detailed information on chart configurations and options)\n\n## Copyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
