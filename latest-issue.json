[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using `next/navigation` within Next.js Middleware, specifically the inability to directly use navigation functions like `redirect` within the middleware context.  While middleware is excellent for manipulating requests before rendering, its environment lacks the client-side context needed for the navigation helpers.  This results in errors like `Error: You can only use the next/navigation functions within a component` or unexpected behavior.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nAttempting to use `next/navigation` functions (like `redirect`, `replace`, or `push`) inside a Next.js Middleware function will lead to a runtime error.  This is because middleware runs on the server-side, before the page component is rendered, where the client-side routing context necessary for these functions is unavailable.\n\n## Step-by-step Code Fix\n\nInstead of directly using `next/navigation` in middleware, we must redirect via HTTP headers. This requires manipulating the `response` object within the middleware.  Let's consider a scenario where we want to redirect users to the `/login` page if they are not authenticated.\n\n**Incorrect Approach (Will Throw an Error):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation' // This will cause an error\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    redirect('/login') // Error: You can only use the next/navigation functions within a component\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Approach (Using HTTP Redirection):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code utilizes `NextResponse.redirect()`. This method accepts a URL object (created using `new URL('/login', req.url)`) and sets the appropriate HTTP headers (specifically, a 307 temporary redirect) to redirect the client's browser to the specified URL. This works because it manipulates the HTTP response directly, a task perfectly suitable within the middleware context.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  (Refer to the section on manipulating the response object)\n* **NextResponse API Reference:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse) (Focus on the `redirect` method)\n\n\n## Explanation Summary\n\nThe key difference lies in understanding the environment. Middleware operates on the server-side before rendering, lacking the client-side routing context needed by `next/navigation`.  Therefore, to redirect from middleware, directly manipulate the `response` using `NextResponse.redirect()` to leverage HTTP redirection, avoiding the `next/navigation` functions altogether.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
