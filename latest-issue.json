[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS. No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that smoothly expands to reveal more content when clicked.  This technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a polished user experience.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis example uses pure CSS to create a card that expands vertically when clicked.  The expansion reveals hidden content initially collapsed using `max-height: 0;` and the `overflow: hidden;`. A smooth transition is achieved using the `transition` property.  We'll also use some basic styling for aesthetics.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content initially */\n  transition: max-height 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial collapsed height */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate clickability */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n}\n\n.card.expanded {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Expanded height */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded')\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Click to Expand</h3>\n    <p>This is some hidden content that will be revealed when the card is expanded.  You can add as much content as you like here.</p>\n    <p>More content can be added here to demonstrate the expanding functionality.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-height: 100px;`:** This limits the initial height of the card, hiding any content beyond the first 100px.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`:** This prevents the hidden content from overflowing and becoming visible.\n* **`transition: max-height 0.5s ease-in-out;`:** This is crucial for the smooth animation. It specifies that the `max-height` property should transition over 0.5 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.\n* **`.card.expanded { max-height: 300px; }`:** This class is added to the card when it's clicked (via `classList.toggle('expanded')`). This increases the `max-height`, revealing the hidden content.\n* **`onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded')\"`:** This inline JavaScript toggles the `expanded` class on the card element when clicked, triggering the height change.  This could be replaced with JavaScript event listeners for a cleaner separation of concerns if preferred.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - MDN documentation on CSS transitions.\n* [CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - MDN documentation on CSS transforms (while not directly used here, they are closely related and often used in conjunction with transitions).\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
