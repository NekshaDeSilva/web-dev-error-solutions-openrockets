[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card using only CSS, incorporating a smooth animation for a visually appealing effect.  This example uses plain CSS3, but could easily be adapted to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to create an expanding card effect.  When the card is hovered over, it increases in size and subtly changes its opacity.  The animation is smooth and natural, enhancing the user experience. The styling emphasizes clean lines and a modern look.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 150px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for animation */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content overflow during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.1); /* Expand the card on hover */\n  opacity: 0.9; /* Slightly reduce opacity on hover */\n  box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">My Expanding Card</h3>\n    <p>This is some sample text inside the card.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class defines the basic style of the card including width, height, background color, border radius, and box shadow.  The `transition` property is crucial for the animation.  It specifies that all properties should transition smoothly over 0.3 seconds using an \"ease-in-out\" timing function. `overflow: hidden` prevents content from spilling out during the scaling animation.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  `transform: scale(1.1)` increases the size of the card by 10%.  `opacity: 0.9` slightly reduces the opacity for a subtle visual cue. The `box-shadow` is enhanced to provide a more pronounced shadow.\n* **`.card-content` and `.card-title`:** These classes style the content inside the card, adding padding, text alignment, and a title style.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Transforms:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Box Shadow:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Box Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
