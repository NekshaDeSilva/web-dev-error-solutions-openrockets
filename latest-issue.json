[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when developing API routes in Next.js: the \"Headers already sent\" error.  This usually happens when you try to send a response header after the response body has already started being sent to the client. This is particularly problematic in Next.js API routes because they rely on correctly setting headers to control caching, CORS, and other crucial aspects of the API response.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe \"Headers already sent\" error manifests as a fatal error in your Next.js application's server logs, preventing the API route from functioning correctly.  It indicates that your code has attempted to set HTTP headers after data has already been sent to the client (often implicitly by accidental output, like `console.log` calls). The browser receives an incomplete or garbled response.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nImagine an API route that retrieves data from a database and sends it as a JSON response. A common mistake is accidentally logging data to the console *after* `res.json()` has been called:\n\n```javascript\n// Incorrect code:\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  res.json(data);  // Sending the response\n  console.log(\"Data sent successfully!\"); // This will cause the error!\n}\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\n1. **Identify the culprit:** Carefully examine your API route code, paying close attention to the order of operations.  Look for any `console.log`, `print`, or other output statements *after* you've called methods like `res.json()`, `res.send()`, or `res.status()`.  Also check for any accidental HTML or text output before the response methods are called.\n\n2. **Reorder your code:** Move any logging or other output statements *before* you send the response:\n\n```javascript\n// Corrected code:\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  console.log(\"Data fetched successfully!\"); // Moved this line before sending the response\n  res.json(data);\n}\n```\n\n3. **Check for unintended output:** Inspect your code for any unintentional outputs.  A common oversight is to render a template or include HTML outside the conditional blocks controlling your responses:\n\n```javascript\n// Incorrect code (unintentional HTML output):\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  if (data) {\n    res.json(data);\n  } else {\n     // ERROR:  This will output HTML directly to the client before headers can be set!\n     res.write(\"<p>No data found</p>\"); // this is a problem\n     res.end()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n//Corrected code (using status codes for error handling):\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n  if (data) {\n    res.json(data);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: \"No data found\" }); // Correct approach\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n4. **Handle errors gracefully:** Wrap your asynchronous operations in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors. This prevents unhandled exceptions from interfering with the response:\n\n\n```javascript\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  try {\n    const data = await fetchData();\n    res.json(data);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: \"Failed to fetch data\" });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe \"Headers already sent\" error arises from a fundamental constraint of the HTTP protocol.  Once the server begins sending the response body, it cannot alter the headers.  Any attempt to do so after the body has started results in this error.  Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that all header settings are complete *before* any data is written to the response stream.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [HTTP Header Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n* [Node.js `res.writeHead()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_serverrequest_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers) (for a deeper understanding of how headers are sent)\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
