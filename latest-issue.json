[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card using only CSS.  The card reveals additional content smoothly on hover, employing a simple yet effective animation.  We'll be using plain CSS3 for this, making it easily adaptable to any project.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card consists of two main parts: a front and a back. The front displays a summary, and the back expands to reveal more detailed information when the user hovers over the card. We achieve the expansion and reveal using CSS transitions and transformations.  The styling emphasizes clean lines and a subtle, elegant animation.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  perspective: 1000px; /* Enables 3D transformations */\n  margin: 20px auto;\n  transition: transform 0.5s ease; /* Smooth transition for transform property */\n}\n\n.card-inner {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  transition: transform 0.5s ease; /* Smooth transition for transform property */\n}\n\n.card-front, .card-back {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  backface-visibility: hidden; /* Prevents the back from showing through */\n}\n\n.card-front {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  color: #333;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n\n.card-back {\n  background-color: #ddd;\n  color: #333;\n  padding: 20px;\n  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Initially hidden on the back */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-inner {\n  transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Rotate on hover to reveal back */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-inner\">\n    <div class=\"card-front\">Summary</div>\n    <div class=\"card-back\">\n      <h2>Detailed Information</h2>\n      <p>This is the back of the card, revealing more detailed information about the subject.  You can add as much content as you like here!</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`perspective`:** This property on the `.card` element creates the 3D space necessary for the rotation.\n* **`transform` and `transition`:** These properties handle the animation of rotating the card. The `transition` provides a smooth effect.\n* **`backface-visibility: hidden;`:**  This prevents the back of the card from being visible before the flip.\n* **`rotateY(180deg)`:** This rotates the card around the Y-axis, flipping it over.  The initial rotation on the `.card-back` hides it and the hover effect reveals it.\n* **`card-front` and `card-back`:** These divs represent the front and back of the card, respectively.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks (general CSS learning resource):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
