[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and the `:hover` pseudo-class to smoothly expand a card on mouse hover. We'll use plain CSS for this example, but the principles could easily be adapted for a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card will start small and have a fixed width. On hover, the card's width will expand, revealing more content.  A smooth transition will enhance the visual appeal. Weâ€™ll also use some basic styling for aesthetics.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for width */\n  width: 200px; /* Initial width */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content overflow during transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  width: 400px; /* Expanded width on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  /*Optional styling for content within the card*/\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content within the expanding card.  You can add more text and elements here as needed. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card element.  `background-color`, `border`, `border-radius`, and `padding` provide basic styling.  Crucially, `transition: width 0.3s ease-in-out;` sets up a smooth transition for the `width` property over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function. `width: 200px;` sets the initial width. `overflow: hidden;` ensures that content doesn't spill outside the card during the expansion.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it. `width: 400px;` increases the width, triggering the transition defined in the `.card` class.\n* **`.card-content`:** This optional class styles the content within the card.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Pseudo-classes:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)\n* **CSS-Tricks (a great resource for CSS techniques):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
