[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands vertically to reveal hidden content when hovered over, providing a clean and engaging user experience. This example utilizes standard CSS3 properties, making it widely compatible and easy to understand.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a simple structure with a container div holding the visible header and hidden content.  The key to the effect is utilizing CSS transitions on `height` and `max-height` properties, along with a clever use of `overflow: hidden` to initially conceal the content.  On hover, the `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand, smoothly animated by the transition.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initially collapsed */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-header {\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">\n    <h3>Click Me!</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is some hidden content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>You can add as much content as you like here.  The card will smoothly expand to accommodate it.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container. `overflow: hidden` is crucial for hiding the content initially.  The `transition` property defines a smooth animation for the `max-height` change. `max-height` is set to a small value initially.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `max-height` is increased, triggering the animation.  Adjust this value to control the final expanded height.\n* **`.card-header` and `.card-content`:**  These classes simply style the header and content sections for better visual presentation.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **CSS Transitions:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS Animations:**  [MDN Web Docs - CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) (For more complex animations beyond simple transitions)\n* **CSS Overflow Property:** [MDN Web Docs - CSS Overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
