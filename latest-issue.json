[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error developers encounter when working with Next.js API routes: a `404 Not Found` error. This often arises from misconfigurations in the API route file's path, incorrect method handling, or problems with the request itself.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Error: Request failed with status code 404` indicates that the client's request to your API route could not be found.  The server couldn't locate a matching route handler to process the request, resulting in a 404 response. This might be due to a typo in the URL, an incorrect routing configuration in `next.config.js` (though less common for simple API routes), or a problem within the API route itself (e.g., incorrect `path` definition or missing route handler).\n\n\n## Code Example & Step-by-Step Fix\n\nLet's assume we have an API route designed to fetch user data.  The following code demonstrates a common scenario leading to a 404 and its solution:\n\n**Problematic Code (pages/api/user/[id].js):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/user/[id].js\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { id } = req.query;\n\n  // Simulate fetching user data (replace with your actual data fetching logic)\n  const user = { id: id, name: `User ${id}` };\n\n  if (user) {\n    res.status(200).json(user);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: \"User not found\" });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Problem:** This code might return a 404 if the `id` parameter isn't correctly passed in the URL (e.g., `/api/user` without an ID).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe'll enhance the code to explicitly handle missing `id` parameters and provide better error handling:\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/user/[id].js (Corrected)\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { id } = req.query;\n\n  // Check if id is provided\n  if (!id) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: \"Missing user ID\" });\n  }\n\n  // Simulate fetching user data (replace with your actual data fetching logic)\n  const user = { id: id, name: `User ${id}` };\n\n  if (user) {\n    res.status(200).json(user);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: \"User not found\" });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis corrected version explicitly checks for the existence of the `id` parameter. If it's missing, it returns a 400 (Bad Request) status code, providing a clearer error message to the client.\n\n**Further Debugging Steps:**\n\n1. **Verify the API Route Path:** Double-check that the file path (`pages/api/user/[id].js` in this example) matches the URL you're using to access it.  Any discrepancies will result in a 404.\n\n2. **Inspect Network Tab:** Use your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) to inspect the Network tab. This shows the request and response details, including the status code.  A 404 here confirms the problem is server-side.\n\n3. **Check Server Logs:** Examine your server logs for any additional error messages that might provide further clues about the cause of the 404.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `404 Not Found` error in Next.js API routes arises when the server cannot match the incoming request to a defined route handler.  This happens when the URL requested doesn't correspond to any `pages/api` file.  Properly defining the route structure (using dynamic segments like `[id]` correctly) and handling potential missing parameters are crucial for preventing these errors.  Good error handling in your API route code itself is also essential for providing informative feedback to the client.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/error-handling)\n* [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
