[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen interacting with the Discord API using Discord.js, you might encounter a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This happens when your bot sends requests to the Discord API faster than the allowed rate limits.  These limits are in place to prevent abuse and ensure the stability of the Discord service.  The error manifests as a HTTP 429 response, often including details about the retry-after time in the response headers.  Ignoring these rate limits can lead to your bot being temporarily or permanently banned from the API.\n\n## Fixing the Error Step-by-Step\n\nThis example demonstrates how to handle rate limits using the built-in functionality of the `discord.js` library (version v14 or later).  Older versions require more manual handling.\n\n**Step 1:  Install the necessary library (if you haven't already):**\n\n```bash\nnpm install discord.js\n```\n\n**Step 2:  Implement rate limit handling:**\n\nThe newer versions of `discord.js` handle many rate limits automatically. However, for more robust control and handling of edge cases, you can use the `rateLimit` property within the `fetch` function. This is particularly important for custom API calls outside of the standard client methods.  \n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, IntentsBitField } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds] }); // Replace with your intents\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n\n  // Example of making a request that might hit rate limits\n  async function sendMessageWithRateLimitHandling(channel, message) {\n    try {\n      const sentMessage = await channel.send(message);\n      console.log('Message sent successfully!');\n      return sentMessage;\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code === 50035) { //If the message is too long, handle this appropriately\n        console.error(\"Message too long\");\n        // Handle the error - split the message or inform the user.\n        return null;\n      }\n      if (error.httpStatus === 429) {\n        console.error('Rate limited!', error);\n        const retryAfter = error.rateLimitReset - Date.now();\n        console.log(`Retrying in ${retryAfter}ms`);\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter)); // Wait before retrying\n        return sendMessageWithRateLimitHandling(channel,message); // Recursive call to retry\n      }\n      console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n      throw error; // Re-throw other errors\n    }\n  }\n\n\n  // Example usage:\n  const channel = client.channels.cache.get('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'); // Replace with your channel ID\n  if (channel) {\n      sendMessageWithRateLimitHandling(channel,\"This is a test message to check rate limits\");\n  } else {\n      console.error(\"Channel not found!\");\n  }\n\n});\n\nclient.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace with your bot token\n```\n\n**Step 3:  Understand the `retryAfter` property:**\n\nThe `error` object (when a 429 is caught) usually contains a `rateLimitReset` property.  This timestamp indicates when the rate limit will reset.  The code above calculates the time to wait before retrying.  This ensures your bot doesn't overwhelm the API.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe code robustly handles rate limits by catching the `429` error, extracting the `retryAfter` time, and waiting before retrying the operation. The recursive call to `sendMessageWithRateLimitHandling` allows for multiple retries if necessary. The implementation also includes a check for 50035 to catch messages exceeding the length limit.  Remember to replace `\"YOUR_CHANNEL_ID\"` and `\"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\"` with your actual values.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Discord.js Guide:** [https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) (General documentation, including rate limits)\n* **Discord API Rate Limits:** [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) (Official Discord API documentation on rate limits)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
