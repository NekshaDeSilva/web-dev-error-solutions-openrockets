[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required! This effect involves a card that smoothly expands on hover, revealing additional content. We'll utilize CSS transitions and transforms to achieve this elegant animation.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will be a simple rectangular element with a background image.  On hover, the card will increase in height, revealing text initially hidden by overflow.  A subtle shadow effect will be added for depth. We will use only standard CSS properties, not a CSS framework like Tailwind.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 200px;\n  background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/300x200'); /* Replace with your image */\n  background-size: cover;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 400px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  color: white;\n  opacity: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for opacity change */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  opacity: 1; /* Show on hover */\n}\n\n.card-text {\n    font-size: 16px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is some extra content revealed on hover.  You can add as much text as you like here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nReplace `https://via.placeholder.com/300x200` with a URL to your preferred background image.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This line creates a smooth transition for the `height` property over 0.3 seconds, using an `ease-in-out` timing function.\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**: This prevents the content from overflowing the card before the hover effect.\n* **`opacity: 0;`**: Initially hides the card content.\n* **`transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: Creates a smooth transition for the `opacity` property when the card is hovered.\n* **`.card:hover { height: 400px; }`**:  Increases the card's height on hover, revealing the hidden content.\n* **`.card:hover .card-content { opacity: 1; }`**:  Makes the content visible on hover.\n\n\n## Links to Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)\n* **MDN Web Docs CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks (General CSS learning):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
