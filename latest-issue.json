[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution for creating an expanding card effect.  No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that expands vertically to reveal additional content when clicked. This is achieved using CSS transitions and the `max-height` property.  We'll be using plain CSS3, but the concepts could easily be adapted to a framework like Tailwind CSS.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is styled with a simple border and padding.  The crucial part is the use of `max-height` set initially to a smaller value.  On hover, the `max-height` is increased to allow the content to expand.  CSS transitions smooth this expansion.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows the max-height */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add smooth transition */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  cursor: pointer; /* Indicate it's clickable */\n}\n\n.card:hover, .card.expanded {\n  max-height: 500px; /* Height when expanded */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\" onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded');\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Card Title</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content that will expand when you click the card.  This text is long enough to demonstrate the expanding effect.  You can add as much content as you like here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the card itself. `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent the content from spilling outside the card before it expands. The `transition` property makes the height change smooth.  `max-height: 100px;` sets the initial height.\n* **`.card:hover, .card.expanded`:** This selector targets the card when hovered over or when the `expanded` class is added (via the `onclick` event).  `max-height: 500px;` sets the expanded height.\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the content inside the card.\n* **`onclick=\"this.classList.toggle('expanded');\"`:** This inline JavaScript simply toggles the `expanded` class on the card when it's clicked.  This could be replaced with JavaScript event listeners for more complex interactions if needed.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks on Transitions:** [https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
