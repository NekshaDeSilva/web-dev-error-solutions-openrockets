[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with API routes in Next.js: `Error: Route Not Found`. This usually happens when a client attempts to access an API route that doesn't exist or is improperly configured.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Error: Route Not Found` in Next.js API routes typically occurs when the client requests a URL that doesn't match any defined API route within your `pages/api` directory.  This could be due to typos in the URL, incorrect routing configuration, or a missing API route handler.  The error is usually presented as a 404 error in the client's browser or network tools.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume you're trying to create an API route to fetch data, but you encounter the `Route Not Found` error. Here's how to fix it:\n\n**Problem Scenario:** You want an API route at `/api/getdata` but mistyped it as `/api/getdat`.\n\n**1. Verify the API Route File:**\n\nEnsure you have a file named `pages/api/getdata.js` (or `.ts` for TypeScript) in your Next.js project. If the file is missing, create it.\n\n**2. Correct the API Route Handler:**\n\nMake sure the file's content correctly handles the API request. Here's an example using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/getdata.js\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    const data = { message: 'Data fetched successfully!' };\n    res.status(200).json(data);\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Correct the Client-Side Request:**\n\nDouble-check that your client-side code (e.g., in a React component using `fetch` or `axios`) is correctly requesting the API route at `/api/getdata`.\n\n```javascript\n// Client-side fetch example\nfetch('/api/getdata')\n  .then(res => res.json())\n  .then(data => console.log(data))\n  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n```\n\n**4. Rebuild and Restart the Development Server:**\n\nAfter making changes to your API routes, ensure you rebuild your Next.js application and restart your development server (usually `npm run dev`).\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe `pages/api` directory is specifically designated for API routes in Next.js. Any file placed within this directory automatically becomes an API endpoint. The filename (without the extension) determines the route.  If a request doesn't match any filename in this directory, Next.js returns a 404 \"Route Not Found\" error.  Correcting the filename, handler function, and client-side request URL ensures the API route is correctly defined and accessed.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* **Handling HTTP Methods in API Routes:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/methods) (For handling POST, PUT, DELETE etc.)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
