[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common problem encountered when using VideoJS on iOS Safari involves playback failure due to MIME type mismatches.  Safari might refuse to play a video if the server doesn't send the correct MIME type header along with the video file.  This results in an error where the video either won't load at all, or will show a loading spinner indefinitely.  The error message might not be very descriptive, making debugging challenging.\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nThe solution often involves ensuring the server correctly sets the `Content-Type` header for your video files. This usually requires making changes on your server-side code (e.g., your web server configuration, or within your application's backend).  The exact steps will depend on your server setup, but the core idea remains the same.\n\nHere are example fixes for common server configurations:\n\n**1. Apache (.htaccess):**\n\nAdd or modify the following lines within your `.htaccess` file to correctly set the MIME types for common video formats:\n\n```apache\nAddType video/mp4 .mp4\nAddType video/webm .webm\nAddType video/ogg .ogv\n```\n\n**2. Nginx:**\n\nAdd or modify the MIME type definitions within your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf` or a relevant server block):\n\n```nginx\nmime_types {\n    video/mp4 mp4;\n    video/webm webm;\n    video/ogg ogv;\n}\n```\n\n**3.  Backend Code (Example: Node.js with Express):**\n\nIf you're serving videos directly from your Node.js backend using Express, you can set the MIME type in your response:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.get('/video/:filename', (req, res) => {\n  const path = `./videos/${req.params.filename}`;\n  const stat = fs.statSync(path);\n  const fileSize = stat.size;\n  const range = req.headers.range;\n\n  if (range) {\n    // Handle partial content requests (for better streaming) - omitted for simplicity\n  }\n\n  const head = {\n    'Content-Length': fileSize,\n    'Content-Type': 'video/mp4' // Adjust according to your video file type\n  };\n  res.writeHead(200, head);\n  const stream = fs.createReadStream(path);\n  stream.pipe(res);\n});\n```\n\n\nRemember to replace  `'video/mp4'` with the correct MIME type based on your video file extension (e.g., `'video/webm'`, `'video/ogg'`).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **File Extensions:** Make sure the file extensions of your video files accurately reflect their format (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`). Inconsistent naming can lead to further problems.\n* **Caching:** Clear your browser's cache and try again after making server-side changes.\n* **Server-Side Logging:**  Check your server logs for any errors related to file serving or MIME types.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\niOS Safari is particularly strict about MIME types. If the server doesn't explicitly state the video's MIME type, the browser might interpret the file incorrectly or refuse to play it altogether for security reasons. The code fixes above ensure the server sends the correct information to the browser, allowing it to identify and play the video properly.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [VideoJS Documentation](https://videojs.com/)\n* [HTTP MIME Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)\n* [Apache MIME Type Configuration](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_mime.html)\n* [Nginx MIME Type Configuration](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#mime_types)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
