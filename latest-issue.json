[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to smoothly animate the card's expansion when hovered over.  No JavaScript is required.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThis design creates a card with a subtle shadow. On hover, the card expands slightly, revealing more content and creating a visually appealing interactive element.  The expansion uses a CSS transform `scale()` to smoothly enlarge the card, and a transition property to control the animation speed.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #fff;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 20px;\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for smooth effect */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during expansion */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05); /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  height: 100px; /* Adjust as needed for initial height */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Add transition for max-height change */\n}\n\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  max-height: 300px; /* Adjust as needed for expanded height */\n}\n\n/* Example Content Styling */\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n.card p {\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h2>Card Title</h2>\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <p>This is some example content that will expand when you hover over the card.  Add more content as needed to test the expansion effect.  You can also adjust the heights in the CSS to change the expansion amount.</p>\n    <p>More example content here...</p>\n    <p>Even more content to demonstrate the expanding functionality.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`**: This class styles the base card with background color, border-radius, box-shadow, and padding.  The `transition` property is crucial; it defines a smooth transformation when the `transform` property changes.  `overflow: hidden` prevents content from spilling outside the card during the animation.\n* **`.card:hover`**: This selector targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `transform: scale(1.05);` property enlarges the card by 5% on hover.\n* **`.card-content`**: This class styles the content area within the card.  The `max-height` property is controlled by the hover effect, and the transition ensures a smooth animation.  `overflow: hidden` prevents content from appearing prematurely.\n* **`.card:hover .card-content`**: This selector targets the content area only when the mouse hovers over the card, changing the `max-height` to reveal more content.\n\n**Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS-Tricks:**  (Search for \"CSS animations\" or \"CSS transitions\" on their site for numerous tutorials)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
