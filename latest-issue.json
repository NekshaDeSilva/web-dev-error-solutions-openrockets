[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue developers encounter when working with Next.js API routes: handling 404 (Not Found) errors gracefully.  Unhandled 404 errors can lead to poor user experiences and debugging challenges.  This guide provides a step-by-step approach to implementing robust 404 handling in your API routes.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nWhen a request is made to an API route that doesn't exist or is incorrectly configured, Next.js defaults to returning a generic 500 (Internal Server Error) or sometimes a completely blank response.  This is unhelpful for both the client and the developer, making it difficult to diagnose the problem and provide informative feedback to the user.  A properly handled 404 should return a clear HTTP 404 status code along with a user-friendly message.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume we have an API route at `/api/products/[id].js` which fetches product data based on the provided `id`.  If a product with the given ID doesn't exist, we want to return a 404 error.\n\n**Incorrect (Unhandled 404):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products/[id].js\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const { id } = req.query;\n  const product = await prisma.product.findUnique({ where: { id: parseInt(id) } });\n\n  if (product) {\n    res.status(200).json(product);\n  } else {\n    // This is insufficient - it might still return a 500 or blank response\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Correct (Handled 404):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products/[id].js\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const { id } = req.query;\n  const product = await prisma.product.findUnique({ where: { id: parseInt(id) } });\n\n  if (product) {\n    res.status(200).json(product);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Product not found' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis improved version explicitly sets the HTTP status code to 404 and returns a JSON object containing a user-friendly message.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key improvement is the explicit use of `res.status(404).json({ message: 'Product not found' });`. This ensures that:\n\n1. **Correct HTTP Status Code:** The client receives a 404 status code, indicating that the requested resource was not found.\n2. **Informative Response:** The client receives a JSON message explaining the reason for the 404, allowing for better error handling on the client-side.\n3. **Improved Debugging:**  The 404 response makes debugging significantly easier, as the problem is clearly identified.\n\nFailing to handle 404 errors can lead to confusing error messages for your users and make debugging more challenging for you.  Always explicitly handle potential errors in your API routes.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n* [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/client) -  (Assuming you're using Prisma ORM, adjust accordingly if you use a different database solution)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
