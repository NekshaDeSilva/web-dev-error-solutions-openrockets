[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with API routes in Next.js: the `Request Not Found` error. This usually occurs when a client attempts to access an API route that doesn't exist or is incorrectly defined.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Request Not Found` error in Next.js API routes manifests as a 404 HTTP status code returned to the client.  This indicates that the server couldn't find the requested API endpoint.  The error message might vary depending on your error handling setup, but it essentially communicates that the route is not correctly defined or accessible.\n\nThis often happens due to typos in the route path, incorrect file naming conventions, or problems with your routing configuration.\n\n\n## Code Example & Fixing Steps\n\nLet's assume we have a Next.js application and we want to create an API route to fetch data from a database.  Initially, we might encounter this `Request Not Found` error because of a simple typo in the file name.\n\n**Scenario:** We intend to create an API route at `/api/products`, but accidentally name the file `products.js` instead of `api/products.js`.\n\n**Incorrect File Structure:**\n\n```\npages/\n  api/\n    products.js  <-- Incorrectly named file\n```\n\n**Correct File Structure & Code:**\n\n1. **Correct File Placement:**  Move or rename the file to the correct location:\n\n```\npages/\n  api/\n    products.js  <-- Correctly named file\n```\n\n2. **API Route Code (pages/api/products.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/products.js\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    try {\n      // Fetch data from your database or API here.  Example using a mock:\n      const products = [\n        { id: 1, name: \"Product A\" },\n        { id: 2, name: \"Product B\" },\n      ];\n      res.status(200).json(products);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error fetching products:\", error);\n      res.status(500).json({ error: \"Failed to fetch products\" });\n    }\n  } else {\n    res.status(405).json({ error: \"Method Not Allowed\" });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **Client-Side Fetch (example using `fetch`):**\n\n```javascript\n// Client-side code (e.g., in a Next.js component)\nasync function fetchProducts() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch('/api/products');\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n    }\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n    return data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error fetching products:\", error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy correctly naming and placing the `products.js` file within the `pages/api` directory and ensuring your file exports a default function,  the `Request Not Found` error should be resolved.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nNext.js uses a file-system based routing system.  API routes are specifically located within the `pages/api` directory.  The file name within this directory determines the API route endpoint.  A `Request Not Found` error indicates a mismatch between the requested URL and the available API route files. Itâ€™s crucial to double-check:\n\n* **File Naming:**  The file name must accurately reflect the API route URL.\n* **File Path:** The file must reside within the `pages/api` directory.\n* **Export Default:** Your API route file should export a default function that handles the request.\n* **Client-Side URL:** Verify that the URL used in your client-side fetch request matches the API route exactly.\n\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [Next.js Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
