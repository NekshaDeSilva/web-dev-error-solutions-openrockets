[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: `Error: NextResponse.redirect() must be the only response in a middleware`. This error occurs when you attempt to perform additional actions after calling `NextResponse.redirect()` within your middleware function.  Middleware functions are designed to perform a single action, either redirecting or continuing the request to the next handler.  Attempting to do both results in this error.\n\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe error message clearly states the problem: you cannot combine a redirect with other responses (like sending data or modifying headers) within a single middleware function.  Next.js Middleware is designed for early request processing, focusing on specific actions like authentication, redirection based on route, or setting headers.  Trying to mix these actions leads to the conflict.\n\n**Code Example (Problem):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  if (req.cookies.auth_token) {\n    //Attempt to set a header *and* redirect - this will cause an error!\n    const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.url));\n    response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'Some Value'); //Error Here!\n    return response;\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/protected/:path*',\n};\n```\n\n**Code Example (Solution):**\n\nTo fix this, you must ensure that `NextResponse.redirect()` is the *only* response returned.  If you need to set headers or perform other actions before redirecting, do so before calling the redirect.\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n\n  if (req.cookies.auth_token) {\n    const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.url));\n    //Setting headers is now done before redirect, not after.\n    return response;\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/protected/:path*',\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe revised code separates header manipulation from the redirect. The `NextResponse.redirect()` function inherently takes over the response process. Any attempt to modify it after its execution will lead to the conflict and throw the error.  The solution involves performing all necessary header modifications or other actions *before* calling `NextResponse.redirect()`.  If you need more complex logic, consider using a different approach such as creating a dedicated API route to handle authentication and redirecting from there.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) - The official Next.js documentation on Middleware.
