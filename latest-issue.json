[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This technique leverages CSS transitions and transforms to achieve a smooth, visually appealing animation without relying on JavaScript.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe styling uses a simple card structure with a main container and an inner content area.  The `height` of the inner content is initially set to zero, causing the content to be hidden.  On hover, the `height` is dynamically adjusted to reveal the hidden content, and a transform is applied for a subtle lift effect.  We'll also use a transition property to make the animation smooth.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the card */\n  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions for box-shadow and transform */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n  transform: translateY(-3px); /* subtle lift effect */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that extends beyond the card */\n  transition: height 0.5s ease; /* Smooth height transition */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  height: auto; /* Reveal content on hover */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>This is the title of the card</h2>\n    <p>This is some sample text within the expanding card.  You can add as much content as you like here.  The height of the card will adjust dynamically to accommodate the content.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:**  This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent the content from overflowing before expansion.\n* **`.card-content`:** This class styles the inner content area.  `height: 0;` initially hides the content. `overflow: hidden;` prevents the content from overflowing the card before expansion.\n* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** This targets the card when the mouse hovers over it.\n    * The `height: auto;` removes the height restriction, allowing the content to expand.\n    * The `box-shadow` and `transform` properties create the visual effects.\n* **`transition` property:** This property ensures smooth animations for the height, box-shadow, and transform properties.  The `ease` timing function provides a natural-feeling animation.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - MDN documentation on CSS transitions.\n* [CSS Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - MDN documentation on CSS transforms.\n* [Understanding CSS Pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) - MDN documentation on CSS pseudo-classes.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
