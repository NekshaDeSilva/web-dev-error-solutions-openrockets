[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common `TypeError` encountered when working with localization within Next.js Middleware.  Specifically, we'll tackle the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'locale')`, often appearing when accessing locale information prematurely in your middleware.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThis error arises when your middleware attempts to read the `locale` property from the `req` object (request object) before Next.js has had a chance to properly parse and assign the locale. This frequently happens when using i18n (internationalization) libraries or custom logic that relies on the user's locale being immediately available.  The `req` object doesn't have a populated `locale` property until later in the request handling process.\n\n**Code demonstrating the error:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  const locale = req.locale; // Error occurs here!\n  console.log(\"Locale:\", locale); // undefined\n\n  // ...rest of your middleware logic...\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n```\n\n**Step-by-step code fix:**\n\n1. **Identify the Locale:** Instead of directly accessing `req.locale` within middleware, we'll utilize Next.js's built-in `next/headers` to access the locale information. This ensures that Next.js's internal processes have finished parsing the request before we access the locale.\n\n2. **Use `next/headers`:**  The `next/headers` module provides a structured way to access headers and information associated with the request, including the locale.\n\n3. **Conditional Logic:** To prevent errors, wrap the locale handling in a conditional check, confirming the locale's existence before proceeding.\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  // Accessing the locale from next/headers\n  const headers = req.headers;\n  const locale = headers.get('x-next-i18n-locale');\n\n\n  if (locale) {\n    console.log(\"Locale:\", locale); // Locale is now correctly defined\n    // ...rest of your middleware logic based on the locale...\n\n    //Example: Redirect based on locale\n    if (locale === 'es') {\n        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/es', req.url));\n    }\n    // Add other language redirects here as needed\n\n  } else {\n    // Handle cases where the locale is not found\n    console.log(\"Locale not found. Defaulting to ...\");\n    // Implement your default behavior\n  }\n\n    return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code uses `req.headers.get('x-next-i18n-locale')` to retrieve the locale. This method ensures that the locale is accessed *after* Next.js has correctly processed and set it in the request headers. The conditional statement (`if (locale)`) handles potential situations where the locale might not be set, preventing the error.  The matcher in `config` is also important to avoid infinite redirect loops, by excluding Next.js's internal directories.  We also use `NextResponse.redirect` to show a practical application of locale information within the middleware. You'll likely need to install the `next/server` module if you haven't already.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js Internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/i18n/introduction)\n* [NextResponse API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
