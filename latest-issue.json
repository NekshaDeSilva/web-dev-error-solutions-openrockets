[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe dreaded \"headers already sent\" error in Next.js Middleware is a common frustration.  It occurs when your middleware attempts to set headers after the response has already begun to be sent to the client. This typically happens due to unintended output (e.g., accidental console logs, extra whitespace) *before* the `next()` function is called within your middleware.  This prevents the middleware from correctly modifying the response headers and can lead to unexpected behavior or a broken application.\n\n## Code Example & Step-by-step Fix\n\nLet's imagine you're trying to redirect users to a login page if they're not authenticated.  Here's an example of middleware code that *would* produce the \"headers already sent\" error, followed by the corrected version:\n\n**Problem Code (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js - INCORRECT\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  console.log('Middleware running...'); // Accidental output!\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n```\n\nThe `console.log` statement is the culprit.  It outputs text *before* the `NextResponse.redirect` or `NextResponse.next()` is called, leading to the error.\n\n**Corrected Code (middleware.js):**\n\n```javascript\n// middleware.js - CORRECTED\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('auth-token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'],\n};\n```\n\nSimply removing the `console.log` statement resolves the issue. The order of operations is crucial.  The response headers must be set *before* any output is sent.\n\n## Explanation\n\nNext.js Middleware operates within a very specific context.  It intercepts requests *before* the main application logic executes.  Once the middleware sends a response (explicitly or implicitly via output), it cannot modify the headers further.  This is a fundamental HTTP constraint.  Any data sent to the client *before* the appropriate response headers are set will trigger the \"headers already sent\" error.  Common culprits, besides accidental `console.log` calls, include:\n\n* **Whitespace or extra newline characters** at the beginning or end of your middleware file.\n* **Unhandled errors** that may produce unintended output.\n* **Using `console.log`, `console.error`, etc.** within the middleware before the `next()` or `redirect()` call.\n* **Including HTML or other content directly in the middleware** outside of the response object.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* **Next.js API Routes Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)  (Understanding API routes helps grasp the related concepts)\n* **HTTP Headers:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) (For a deeper understanding of how HTTP headers work)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
