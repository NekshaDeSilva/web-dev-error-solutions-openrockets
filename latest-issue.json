[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error developers encounter when working with Next.js Middleware: the \"headers already sent\" error. This error typically occurs when you attempt to send headers to the client multiple times within a single request.  This often happens due to unintended output before calling `next()`.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe \"headers already sent\" error means that your server (or in Next.js's case, the middleware function) has already begun sending the HTTP response headers to the client, but you're trying to modify or send more headers. This prevents the server from completing the request correctly, resulting in a server error.\n\n**Scenario:**  Imagine a middleware function that checks authentication and sets a custom header.  If there's unintentional logging or output *before* the call to `next()`, it will trigger this error.\n\n\n**Code Example (Problematic):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js (or any middleware file)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  console.log(\"Request received:\", req.url); // This can cause the error if placed incorrectly.\n\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('Auth-User', 'Authenticated'); //Setting a custom header\n  return response;\n}\n\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n**Fixing the Error Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Identify the culprit:** Carefully review your middleware function (or API route) for any unintentional output *before* the `NextResponse` is created or the `next()` function is called. Common offenders include:\n   - `console.log` statements\n   - Unhandled exceptions\n   - Unexpected whitespace or characters (e.g., extra spaces or blank lines) at the beginning of the file.\n\n2. **Move potential outputs:** Ensure that all `console.log` statements, debug messages, or other outputs happen *after* the response is handled. Or better yet, use proper logging tools for production.\n\n\n3. **Clean up:** Remove unnecessary whitespace or stray characters from the top of your file.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js (or any middleware file)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token');\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('Auth-User', 'Authenticated');\n  return response;\n}\n\n//Logging after the response is handled - this is better practice in production\n//export function middleware(req){\n//   const response = ...;\n//   return response;\n//}\n//console.log(\"Request handled:\", req.url);\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/protected/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code moves the `console.log` statement (or any other potential output) *after* the `NextResponse` object is created and returned. This ensures that the headers are sent only once and in the correct order, preventing the \"headers already sent\" error.  In a production environment, use a proper logger that doesn't output directly to the console but rather to logs (like Winston or Bunyan).\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n* [HTTP Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
