[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the dreaded \"headers already sent\" error. This typically happens when you attempt to send headers from your middleware after something else has already sent a response.  This can be particularly tricky to debug because the error message might not always pinpoint the exact location.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error in Next.js (and Node.js in general) occurs when you try to modify HTTP headers after the response has already begun to be sent to the client.  This often happens when you have multiple calls to `res.setHeader()` or other methods that affect the response headers within a single middleware function, or when a middleware function inadvertently writes to the response body (e.g., via a console.log) before setting headers.\n\n\n**Scenario:** Let's say we're trying to redirect all requests to `/about` to `/contact` using middleware.  We might mistakenly write code that tries to modify the response after other operations have altered its state.\n\n\n**Faulty Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/about') {\n    console.log(\"Redirecting from /about to /contact\"); // This might cause the error if logging to console writes to the response\n    const res = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/contact', req.url));\n    res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'my-value'); // This will likely throw the error\n    return res;\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about'],\n};\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix:**\n\n1. **Identify the culprit:** Carefully review your middleware function. Look for any unintended operations that might write to the response before headers are set.  In the faulty code above, the `console.log` is a potential culprit. While not always problematic, in some edge cases it can interact badly with the response object.\n\n2. **Ensure header setting is before any other response modifications:**  The `res.headers.set()` method *must* be called *before* anything that might implicitly send data to the client.  This includes `NextResponse.redirect`, `NextResponse.rewrite`, or implicit writing due to console output or unhandled errors.\n\n\n3. **Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === '/about') {\n    const res = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/contact', req.url));\n    res.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'my-value'); // Setting header BEFORE redirect\n    return res;\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about'],\n};\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, the `res.headers.set()` call is moved *before* the response is sent by `NextResponse.redirect`.  The potential problematic `console.log` remains but is less likely to cause issues as it's before the main response operation. To be completely safe, remove it entirely if not essential.\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key is the order of operations.  The browser expects HTTP headers to be sent first, followed by the response body (the actual content of the page).  If you try to modify headers after the response body (even implicitly through unintended side effects) has already started being sent, the server will throw the `headers already sent` error because it's trying to change something that's already been committed.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Node.js HTTP Headers](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_headers) (For understanding the underlying HTTP principles)\n\n\n**Copyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
