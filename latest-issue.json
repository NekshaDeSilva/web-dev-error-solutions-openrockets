[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when integrating VideoJS into a CanvasJS chart visualization:  failure to initialize the VideoJS player correctly within the CanvasJS chart's rendered area.  This usually manifests as a blank space where the video player should be, or JavaScript errors related to element not found or incorrect DOM manipulation. This specifically focuses on scenarios where the VideoJS player needs to be added dynamically after the CanvasJS chart has rendered.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe core issue stems from timing discrepancies. CanvasJS renders its charts asynchronously.  If you attempt to initialize the VideoJS player before the CanvasJS chart's container element is fully rendered and populated, VideoJS won't find the target element, resulting in a failed initialization.  The error messages might vary, but common indicators include:\n\n* `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'appendChild')`\n* `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': The new child element contains the parent element.`\n*  A blank space where the video player should appear.\n\n\n## Code Fixing Step by Step\n\nThis example demonstrates how to fix this issue by initializing the VideoJS player within the `afterSetOptions` callback of CanvasJS, ensuring the chart's container element is ready.\n\n```javascript\n// CanvasJS Chart Setup\nvar chart = new CanvasJS.Chart(\"chartContainer\", {\n  animationEnabled: true,\n  title: {\n    text: \"Chart with VideoJS Player\"\n  },\n  data: [/* Your chart data here */],\n  afterSetOptions: function() {\n    //Wait for the chart container to be fully rendered\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      //Find the container (replace 'videoContainer' with your container ID or selector within the chart container)\n        const videoContainer = document.getElementById(\"videoContainer\"); // Or use querySelector\n\n        if(videoContainer){ //Check if the container exists before proceeding.\n\n        // Initialize VideoJS Player\n        videojs(\"videoContainer\", {\n          sources: [{ src: \"your-video.mp4\", type: \"video/mp4\" }],\n          autoplay: false,\n          controls: true\n        }).ready(function(){\n          this.play();\n          //VideoJS is ready for use.\n        });\n        } else {\n            console.error('Video Container not found within CanvasJS Chart');\n        }\n    }, 100); //Small timeout to allow for rendering\n  }\n});\nchart.render();\n\n//HTML Structure (Important - add a div inside chartContainer)\n<div id=\"chartContainer\">\n  <div id=\"videoContainer\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n1. **`afterSetOptions` Callback:**  This CanvasJS callback function ensures that the VideoJS initialization code executes only after the chart's options have been set and the DOM elements are ready.  This is crucial for avoiding the \"element not found\" error.\n\n2. **`setTimeout` Function:** The `setTimeout` function adds a small delay (100 milliseconds in this case) to allow for the complete rendering of the CanvasJS chart's elements.  Adjust this value if needed based on your chart's complexity and rendering time.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** The `if(videoContainer)` check prevents errors if the container element isn't found.\n\n4. **VideoJS Initialization:** The standard VideoJS initialization code is used, targeting the `videoContainer` element within the chart's container.\n\n5. **HTML Structure:**  The HTML includes a `div` with the ID \"videoContainer\" *inside* the `chartContainer` div. This ensures that the video player is placed correctly within the chart's visual area.\n\n## External References\n\n* **CanvasJS Documentation:** [https://canvasjs.com/](https://canvasjs.com/) (Check for API references on callbacks)\n* **VideoJS Documentation:** [https://videojs.com/](https://videojs.com/) (Refer to player initialization and options)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
