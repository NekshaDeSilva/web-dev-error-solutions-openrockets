[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered, revealing hidden content.  This uses only CSS3, avoiding JavaScript for a lightweight and performant solution.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card uses a combination of transitions, pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`), and max-height to achieve the expanding effect.  The `::before` pseudo-element is used to create the visually appealing overlay that appears upon hover.  The max-height is initially set to a smaller value, limiting the card's height. Upon hover, the max-height is removed, allowing the card to expand to its full content height.  Transitions ensure a smooth animation.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f2f2f2;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */\n  max-height: 150px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 500px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.card::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Overlay on hover */\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover::before {\n  opacity: 1; /* Show overlay on hover */\n}\n\n.card h2 {\n  margin-top: 0;\n}\n\n.card p {\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2>Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p>This is some example content within the card.  It will expand when you hover over the card.</p>\n    <p>Additional content to demonstrate the expansion effect. Add as much text as you like!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`.card`:**  The main container for the card.  `overflow: hidden` prevents content from overflowing before the expansion.  `max-height` initially restricts the card's height.  `transition` defines the smooth animation.\n* **`.card:hover`:**  Styles applied when the card is hovered over.  `max-height` is removed to allow expansion.\n* **`.card::before`:**  Creates a semi-transparent overlay that appears on hover.\n* **`.card:hover::before`:**  Sets the overlay's opacity to 1 when hovering, making it visible.\n* **`.card-content`:** Contains the actual content of the card.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs - Pseudo-elements:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** Search for \"CSS-only card animations\" on [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) for more advanced examples.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
