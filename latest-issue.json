[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when developing Next.js applications:  `Error: Next Response already sent`. This error typically arises in API routes when multiple responses are attempted within a single request handler.  Next.js API routes expect a single response object to be returned.  Attempting to send multiple responses, either explicitly or implicitly, results in this error.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Error: Next Response already sent` error in Next.js API routes indicates that your API route handler has attempted to send a response to the client more than once.  This often happens due to unexpected behavior like multiple `res.send()` or `res.json()` calls, or perhaps asynchronous operations completing after the initial response has already been sent.\n\n## Example Scenario and Code Fix\n\nLet's consider a scenario where an API route fetches data from two different sources asynchronously, and attempts to send a response after each fetch completes.\n\n**Problematic Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/data.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const data1 = await fetchDataFromSource1();\n  res.status(200).json({ data: data1 }); // First response\n\n  const data2 = await fetchDataFromSource2();\n  res.status(200).json({ data: data2 }); // Second (erroneous) response\n}\n\nasync function fetchDataFromSource1() {\n  // Simulate fetching data\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));\n  return { source: 'source1', value: 'data1' };\n}\n\nasync function fetchDataFromSource2() {\n  // Simulate fetching data\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));\n  return { source: 'source2', value: 'data2' };\n}\n```\n\nThis code will throw the `Error: Next Response already sent` because `res.status(200).json({ data: data2 })` is called after the first response has already been sent.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/data.js\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\n\nexport default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  try {\n    const [data1, data2] = await Promise.all([\n      fetchDataFromSource1(),\n      fetchDataFromSource2(),\n    ]);\n    res.status(200).json({ data1, data2 });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });\n  }\n}\n\nasync function fetchDataFromSource1() {\n  // Simulate fetching data\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));\n  return { source: 'source1', value: 'data1' };\n}\n\nasync function fetchDataFromSource2() {\n  // Simulate fetching data\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));\n  return { source: 'source2', value: 'data2' };\n}\n```\n\nThis revised code uses `Promise.all` to fetch both data sources concurrently.  Once both promises resolve, a single response is sent containing both datasets. The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during data fetching, providing a more robust solution.\n\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe key to resolving this error is ensuring that only a single `res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.status()` (followed by a send method) or similar method is called within the API route handler.  If you have multiple asynchronous operations, use `Promise.all` or similar constructs to wait for all of them to complete before sending the response.  Error handling is also crucial to prevent unexpected behavior from causing this issue.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js API Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) - Official Next.js documentation on API routes.\n* [Next.js Error Handling](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/error-handling) -  Next.js documentation on error handling strategies.\n* [Understanding Promises in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) -  A helpful resource for understanding JavaScript promises.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
