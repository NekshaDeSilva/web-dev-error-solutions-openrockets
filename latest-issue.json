[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common performance issue in MongoDB stemming from excessive or poorly planned indexes.  While indexes are crucial for query optimization, an overabundance of them can significantly degrade write performance and increase storage overhead. This situation often manifests as slow insertion and update operations, despite seemingly optimized queries.\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe primary symptom of having too many indexes is a noticeable slowdown in write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).  This is because MongoDB needs to update all affected indexes whenever a document is modified.  The `db.collection.stats()` command might reveal a high `indexSize` relative to the `dataSize`, indicating potential over-indexing.  Query performance might still be acceptable, potentially masking the underlying problem.  Monitoring tools might show increased write latency and decreased throughput.\n\n\n## Fixing the Problem Step-by-Step\n\nLet's assume we have a collection named \"products\" with indexes on `category`, `price`, `name`, and a compound index on `category` and `price`. This might be excessive, depending on query patterns.  We'll prioritize indexes based on actual usage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Query Patterns**\n\nUse the MongoDB profiler or a monitoring tool like Atlas monitoring to identify frequently executed queries.  This reveals which fields are commonly used in `$match`, `$sort`, and other query operators.  Focus on the `$match` stage as that's where indexes provide the most significant performance gains.\n\n```bash\ndb.system.profile.find({ \"op\" : \"query\" }).sort({ $natural : -1 }).limit(10)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify Underutilized Indexes**\n\nReview the output of the profiler.  If indexes aren't used consistently for specific queries, they're candidates for removal.  For example, if the `name` field is rarely used in queries, its index is unnecessary overhead.\n\n**Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Indexes**\n\nUse the following command to drop indexes that aren't actively improving query performance:\n\n```javascript\n// Remove the index on 'name'\ndb.products.dropIndex(\"name_1\")\n\n// Remove the index on 'price'\ndb.products.dropIndex(\"price_1\") \n```\n\n**Step 4: Optimize Compound Indexes**\n\nCompound indexes can be powerful, but carefully consider the order of fields.  The most selective fields should come first.  If the `category` and `price` compound index is frequently used with `category` first, the order is ideal.  If it's more frequent to filter by `price` and *then* by `category`, the index order should be reversed.  The command to create a corrected index (assuming price is the primary filter):\n\n```javascript\ndb.products.createIndex( { price: 1, category: 1 } )\n```\n\n**Step 5: Re-evaluate Performance**\n\nAfter removing or modifying indexes, re-run performance tests. Use the profiler to verify if indexes are used effectively and if write operations have improved.  You might need to iterate through steps 1-4 until you find an optimal balance between query speed and write performance.\n\n## Explanation\n\nExcessive indexing increases write overhead because MongoDB must update all indexes every time a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.  While indexes speed up reads, this cost can outweigh the benefits if they aren't utilized frequently.  Analyzing query patterns and removing or optimizing indexes based on actual usage improves write performance without sacrificing significant read performance.  Prioritizing effective indexes is crucial for a balanced database design.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MongoDB Indexing Guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/)\n* [MongoDB Performance Tuning](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/optimize-for-performance/)\n* [MongoDB Profiler](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.adminCommand.profile/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
