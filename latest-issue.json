[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common error encountered when working with Next.js Middleware: the \"headers already sent\" error. This usually happens when you attempt to send headers to the response multiple times, often stemming from a mismatch between your middleware and the underlying request handling.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe `headers already sent` error in Next.js Middleware (and generally in Node.js) indicates that the HTTP response headers have already been sent to the client, and a subsequent attempt to modify them (e.g., setting more headers, changing the status code) is invalid. This typically results in a server-side error and a broken user experience.  The error message itself might vary slightly depending on your server environment, but the core problem remains the same.\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you have middleware that redirects users based on certain conditions and also sets custom headers. If you accidentally send headers within the redirection logic *and* later try to set more headers, it will trigger this error.\n\n**Code demonstrating the Error (Incorrect):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {\n    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'initial value'); // First header set\n    res.redirect('/dashboard'); // Redirection starts response\n    res.setHeader('Another-Header', 'this will fail'); // Attempt after redirection\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/']\n}\n```\n\nThis code will fail because `res.redirect` implicitly starts sending the response, preventing further header modifications with `res.setHeader`.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\n1. **Consolidate Header Setting:**  Instead of setting headers after the redirect, set them *before*.\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {\n    res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'initial value');\n    res.setHeader('Another-Header', 'this works now');\n    res.redirect('/dashboard');\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/']\n}\n```\n\n2. **Conditional Header Setting (More Robust):**  For more complex scenarios, use a boolean flag to track whether headers have already been sent.\n\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  let headersSent = false;\n  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {\n    if (!headersSent) {\n      res.setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'initial value');\n      res.setHeader('Another-Header', 'this is safe');\n      headersSent = true;\n    }\n    res.redirect('/dashboard');\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/']\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe key to avoiding the \"headers already sent\" error is to ensure that all header modifications happen *before* any part of the response body is sent to the client. `res.redirect`, `res.end`, `res.write`, and similar methods implicitly begin the response process. Any header changes after these operations will cause the error.  The second fix with `headersSent` is a more defensive approach, suitable for cases with complex logic where header setting might happen in multiple places.\n\n**External References:**\n\n* [Next.js Middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [Node.js HTTP Response Object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) (Understanding how the underlying response object works)\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe \"headers already sent\" error in Next.js middleware is usually a simple oversight. By carefully organizing your code to set headers before starting the response process (using redirects or writing to the response body), you can easily prevent this common issue.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
