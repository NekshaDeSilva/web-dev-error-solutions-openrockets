[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create an expanding card effect using only CSS.  This effect involves a card that, on hover, expands to reveal more content. We will use pure CSS3 for this effect, making it lightweight and performant.\n\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card will initially be compact, displaying only a title and a small image. On hover, the card expands vertically to reveal additional text content hidden by default. The expansion will be smooth and visually appealing, achieved through CSS transitions. We'll also style the card with basic shadows and rounded corners for a modern look.\n\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  width: 200px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflowing content during transition */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height */\n}\n\n.card img {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 10px;\n  max-height: 0; /* Initially hidden */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflowing content */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  max-height: 200px; /* Expand on hover */\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  margin-bottom: 5px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/200x150\" alt=\"Card Image\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h3 class=\"card-title\">Card Title</h3>\n    <p>This is some extra content that will be revealed when you hover over the card.  It demonstrates a simple expanding card effect created entirely with CSS.  Enjoy!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;`**: This is the core of the animation. It smoothly changes the `max-height` property over 0.3 seconds using an ease-in-out timing function.  This is applied to both the `.card` and `.card-content` to ensure a coordinated expansion.\n\n* **`max-height: 0;`**: This initially hides the content within `.card-content`.\n\n* **`max-height: 200px;`**: On hover, this expands the `.card-content` to a height of 200px, revealing the hidden text. Adjust this value to control the expansion height.\n\n* **`overflow: hidden;`**:  This is crucial. It hides any content that extends beyond the `max-height`. Without it, the content would overflow during the transition, ruining the effect.\n\n* **`transition` on `.card`**: Applying `transition` to the main `.card` container helps ensure smooth visual changes even when the content height expands and forces the outer element to resize.\n\n## Resources to Learn More\n\n* **MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **CSS-Tricks:** Search for \"CSS only card hover effects\" on [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) for more advanced techniques and variations.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
