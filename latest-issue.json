[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common issue when working with Next.js Middleware is incorrectly manipulating the `headers` object within the `Response` object.  Specifically, attempting to directly modify the `headers` property often results in unexpected behavior or errors.  This is because the `headers` object in the `Response` isn't a mutable plain JavaScript object; it's an instance with specific methods for modification. Trying to assign properties directly (e.g., `response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'value')`) will not work as expected, and might lead to silent failures or your headers not being set properly.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Code Fix\n\nLet's assume we want to add a custom header `X-Custom-Header` with the value `my-custom-value` to the response in our middleware.  The incorrect and correct approaches are demonstrated below:\n\n**Incorrect Approach:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n  response.headers.set('X-Custom-Header', 'my-custom-value'); // INCORRECT\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  const response = NextResponse.next();\n\n  // Correct way to add headers: Using the `headers` method of NextResponse.\n  const updatedResponse = new NextResponse(response.body, {\n    headers: {\n      ...response.headers,\n      'X-Custom-Header': 'my-custom-value',\n    },\n  });\n\n  return updatedResponse;\n}\n```\n\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\nThe correct approach uses the `NextResponse` constructor to create a *new* `Response` object.  We use the spread syntax (`...response.headers`) to copy all existing headers from the original `response` and then add our custom header.  This ensures that all headers are correctly handled and that our custom header is included.  Directly manipulating the `headers` property of the original `response` object won't persist the change.\n\n## External References\n\n* **Next.js API Routes and Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/introduction](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-routes/introduction)  (Look for sections on Middleware and Response objects)\n* **MDN Web Docs - Response Object:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) (For a broader understanding of the `Response` object in the browser context)\n* **Next.js Server-Side Rendering:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) (Understanding how middleware interacts with rendering)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nRemember to use the `NextResponse` constructor to create a new response object with the updated headers, rather than directly modifying the `headers` property of the existing response. This ensures that your header changes are correctly applied.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
