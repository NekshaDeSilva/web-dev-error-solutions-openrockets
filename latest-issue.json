[{"body":"\nThis document details how to create a visually appealing diagonal split layout using only CSS.  We'll achieve this effect without relying on images or JavaScript, showcasing the power and flexibility of CSS. This example uses plain CSS; adapting it to Tailwind CSS is straightforward by replacing the inline styles with corresponding Tailwind classes.\n\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe layout consists of two divs, one positioned on top of the other.  The top div uses a linear gradient background with a diagonal line created by the `linear-gradient` function.  The bottom div is positioned absolutely to cover the remaining portion of the screen.  Using `clip-path` on the top div allows for precise control over the diagonal split, creating a clean and sharp division.\n\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Diagonal Split Layout</title>\n<style>\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n.container {\n  width: 100vw;\n  height: 100vh;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents content from overflowing */\n}\n\n.top {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #f06d06, #f06d06); /*Orange color*/\n  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0% 100%); /* Adjust percentage for angle */\n}\n\n.bottom {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background-color: #282c34; /* Dark background color */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"top\"></div>\n  <div class=\"bottom\"></div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`body { margin: 0; }`**: Removes default body margins for a full-screen effect.\n* **`.container`**:  Sets up a full viewport container. `overflow: hidden` is crucial to keep the elements within the container's bounds.\n* **`.top`**:  This div is the top, orange section.  The `linear-gradient` creates the orange background.  The `clip-path: polygon(...)` defines the shape. The coordinates (0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0% 100%) represent the vertices of the polygon, creating the diagonal split.  You can adjust the percentage (75% in this case) to change the angle of the split.\n* **`.bottom`**: This div is positioned absolutely within the container, covering the area below the diagonal cut.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on `linear-gradient`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)\n* **MDN Web Docs on `clip-path`:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)\n* **CSS-Tricks (general CSS resources):** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
