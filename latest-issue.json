[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  No JavaScript is required. The effect involves a card that smoothly expands vertically when hovered over, revealing additional content. We'll utilize CSS transitions and transforms for a polished animation.\n\n## Description of the Styling\n\nThe card starts with a collapsed height, showing only a header. On hover, the card expands to its full height, revealing the body content.  The expansion is smooth thanks to CSS transitions. We'll also add a subtle shadow effect to enhance the visual appeal. This technique is suitable for showcasing product information, articles, or any content needing a visually engaging reveal.\n\n## Full Code\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */\n  transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  height: 100px; /* Initial collapsed height */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  height: 300px; /* Expanded height on hover */\n}\n\n.card-header {\n  background-color: #4CAF50;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 15px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.card-body {\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-header\">\n    <h3>Expanding Card</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n    <p>This is the body of the expanding card.  More content can be added here.  This demonstrates a simple yet effective way to create interactive elements using only CSS.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n* **`.card`:** This class styles the main card container.  `overflow: hidden;` is crucial to prevent content from peeking out during the height transition.  `transition: height 0.3s ease-in-out;` defines the smooth transition for the height property, lasting 0.3 seconds with an ease-in-out timing function. The initial height is set to 100px.\n* **`.card:hover`:** This styles the card when the mouse hovers over it.  The `height` is changed to 300px, triggering the transition defined in `.card`.\n* **`.card-header` and `.card-body`:** These classes style the header and body sections of the card, providing basic layout and visual separation.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - Learn more about CSS transitions and their properties.\n* [CSS-Tricks - Understanding CSS Transitions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) - Another excellent resource for understanding CSS transitions.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
