[{"body":"\nThis document details the creation of an expanding card effect using only CSS.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content smoothly. This effect is achieved using CSS transitions and transforms, offering a clean and performant solution without JavaScript.  We'll be using standard CSS3 properties, making it widely compatible.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card starts in a collapsed state, displaying only a title and a small preview. On hover, the card expands to reveal additional content that's initially hidden. The expansion is smooth thanks to CSS transitions, and a subtle box-shadow effect enhances the visual appeal.  A gradient background is added for extra style.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea, #764ba2);\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide content that overflows during transition */\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition for height change */\n  max-height: 100px; /* Initial height */\n  width: 300px;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  max-height: 400px; /* Height when hovered */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 20px;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.card-title {\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n.card-text {\n  font-size: 1em;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n}\n\n.hidden {\n  max-height: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover .hidden {\n  max-height: 200px; /* Height of the hidden content when expanded */\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-content\">\n    <h2 class=\"card-title\">Expanding Card</h2>\n    <p class=\"card-text\">This is a short preview of the card content.</p>\n    <div class=\"hidden\">\n      <p>This is the hidden content that is revealed on hover. You can add more text here to expand the card further.</p>\n      <p>This is another paragraph of hidden content.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`max-height` and `transition`:** The core of the effect lies in the `max-height` property and the `transition` property. We set an initial `max-height` to constrain the card's height, then use `transition` to smoothly animate changes to `max-height` over 0.3 seconds.\n* **`overflow: hidden`:** This prevents the content from overflowing during the transition.\n* **`:hover` pseudo-class:** The `:hover` pseudo-class applies the expanded height only when the mouse is over the card.\n* **`hidden` class:** We use a `hidden` class to initially hide the extra content, revealing it only when the card expands.  This class also uses a transition for smooth appearance.\n* **Background and Styling:** The `background`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` properties are used to enhance the visual appeal of the card.\n\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transitions:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n* **MDN Web Docs on CSS Transforms:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)\n* **CSS Tricks Website:** [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/) (A great resource for CSS tutorials and techniques)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
