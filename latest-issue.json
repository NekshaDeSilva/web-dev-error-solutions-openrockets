[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common problem developers encounter when using the `next/router` object within Next.js Middleware.  Specifically, we'll focus on scenarios where attempting to use router methods like `push` or `replace` results in unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n**Description of the Error:**\n\nThe core issue stems from the execution context of Middleware. Middleware runs *before* the request reaches your page component.  Therefore, the `next/router` object within middleware doesn't have access to the client-side routing functionalities available within a page component.  Attempting to use methods like `router.push()` will typically result in silent failures or unexpected redirects.  You might not see any obvious errors in your console, leading to frustrating debugging sessions.\n\n\n**Step-by-Step Code Fix:**\n\nLet's imagine a scenario where you want to redirect users to the `/login` page if they are not authenticated,  using middleware. A flawed approach (and the source of the common error) would look like this:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (Incorrect Implementation)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    const url = req.nextUrl.clone();\n    url.pathname = '/login'; //This is okay.\n    // The following line is INCORRECT in Middleware!\n    url.push(url); //Attempting client-side navigation in server-side context\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\nThe correct approach leverages `NextResponse.redirect` to handle server-side redirects effectively:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js (Correct Implementation)\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const isAuthenticated = false; // Replace with your authentication logic\n\n  if (!isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n};\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe corrected code utilizes `NextResponse.redirect()`. This function is designed specifically for creating server-side redirects within the middleware context. It takes a `URL` object as an argument, allowing you to specify the target URL for the redirect.  Crucially, this happens *before* the request reaches the client, avoiding the issues associated with using `next/router` in the wrong context.  The `new URL('/login', req.url)` part constructs a new URL object, ensuring the redirect is relative to the current request's URL.\n\n\n**External References:**\n\n* **Next.js Middleware Documentation:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)  (Refer to the section on redirects)\n* **NextResponse API Reference:** [https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
