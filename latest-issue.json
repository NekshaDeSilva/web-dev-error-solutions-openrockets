[{"body":"\nThis document details a CSS-only solution to create an expanding card effect.  The card expands vertically when hovered over, revealing hidden content. This uses pure CSS3, without the need for JavaScript.\n\n**Description of the Styling:**\n\nThe card is composed of two main elements: a container and an inner content section. The container has a fixed height initially.  The inner content section uses `max-height` to control its visible height, and a transition to smoothly animate its height change on hover.  We also add some visual styling for aesthetics.\n\n**Full Code:**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Expanding Card</title>\n<style>\n.card {\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide overflowing content during transition */\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease; /* Add a subtle shadow transition on hover */\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Enhanced shadow on hover */\n}\n\n\n.card-container {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px; /* Initial height */\n  overflow: hidden; /* Hide the expanding content initially */\n}\n\n.card-content {\n  padding: 15px;\n  background-color: white;\n  color: #333;\n  transition: max-height 0.5s ease; /* Smooth height transition */\n  max-height: 150px; /* Initial max height, matches container height */\n}\n\n.card:hover .card-content {\n  max-height: 500px; /* Max height when expanded */\n}\n\n\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <div class=\"card-container\">\n    <div class=\"card-content\">\n      <h2>Card Title</h2>\n      <p>This is some sample text for the card.  You can add as much content as you like.  The card will expand to fit.</p>\n      <p>More text here to demonstrate expansion.</p>\n      <p>Even more text!</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`overflow: hidden;` on `.card` and `.card-container`:** This prevents content from spilling outside the card boundaries during the transition.\n*   **`transition: max-height 0.5s ease;` on `.card-content`:** This creates the smooth animation for the height change.\n*   **`max-height` on `.card-content`:** This controls the visible height of the content, allowing us to expand it dynamically.\n*   **`box-shadow` and `transition` on `.card`:** This is optional but provides additional visual feedback and makes the card look more polished.\n\n**Links to Resources to Learn More:**\n\n*   [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)\n*   [CSS-Tricks - Learn CSS](https://css-tricks.com/)\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
