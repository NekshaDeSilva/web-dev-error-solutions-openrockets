[{"body":"\nThis document addresses a common issue encountered when using Next.js Middleware to perform redirects: the `Request aborted` error. This typically occurs when a redirect is initiated within Middleware, but the client cancels the request before the redirect completes.  This is often due to network issues, slow responses, or the user navigating away from the page.\n\n\n## Description of the Error\n\nThe `Request aborted` error doesn't usually manifest as a specific error message in your Next.js application logs. Instead, it's evidenced by the lack of a successful redirect. The user might experience a blank page, a stalled loading indicator, or an inconsistent behavior depending on the client's network conditions.  Inspecting the network tab of your browser's developer tools might show a request that is cancelled or aborted midway.\n\n\n## Steps to Fix the Issue\n\nThe core problem is that the middleware continues to process even after the client aborts the request.  We need a mechanism to gracefully handle these aborted requests within the middleware itself. We cannot simply check for an aborted request because the abort event is asynchronous; however, we can mitigate it by making our redirect logic as fast as possible.\n\nThis example shows how to protect against this error during a redirect in middleware.\n\n**Before (Problematic Code):**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.url.startsWith('/admin')) {\n    if (!req.cookies.isAdmin) {\n      res.redirect('/login');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],\n};\n```\n\n**After (Improved Code):**\n\nThis improved version doesn't fundamentally change the functionality but significantly reduces the chance of a \"Request aborted\" error by ensuring the redirect happens quickly.  It's less about handling the error explicitly, and more about preventing the situation that leads to it.\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req, res) {\n  if (req.url.startsWith('/admin')) {\n    if (!req.cookies.isAdmin) {\n      //Immediately redirect, no unnecessary delays.\n      res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' }); // 307 Temporary Redirect\n      res.end();\n      return; // Crucial to prevent further processing after the redirect\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/admin/:path*'],\n};\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **`res.writeHead(307, { Location: '/login' });`**: This sets the HTTP status code to 307 (Temporary Redirect) and specifies the redirect location.  Using `writeHead` is faster than `redirect` as it avoids some internal overhead.\n* **`res.end();`**: This is crucial. It immediately closes the response, preventing the middleware from continuing to execute unnecessary code after the redirect has been initiated.\n* **`return;`**:  This explicitly exits the middleware function. Without this, the code after the redirect might still execute, leading to potential conflicts or delays that increase the likelihood of an aborted request.\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [HTTP Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n* [Understanding Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile a true \"Request aborted\" error is difficult to directly catch in Next.js Middleware, optimizing the redirect process to be fast and clean significantly mitigates the problem.  By using `res.writeHead`, `res.end()`, and `return` appropriately, we reduce the chances of the client aborting the request before the redirect completes.\n\n\nCopyrights (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
