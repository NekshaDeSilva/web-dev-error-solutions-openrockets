[{"body":"\n## Description of the Error\n\nA common issue when using Next.js Middleware to perform redirects is improperly handling the `headers` and `cookies` objects.  Attempting to modify cookies directly within the middleware's `response` object during a redirect often leads to unpredictable behavior or silently fails to set the intended cookies. This is particularly problematic when you need to set authentication cookies after redirecting a user to a protected route. The redirect might succeed, but the intended cookies may not be set correctly, causing further authentication issues.\n\n## Code: Step-by-Step Fix\n\nLet's say we want to redirect an unauthenticated user to `/login` after checking for the presence of a session cookie named `token`.  A naive, incorrect approach might look like this:\n\n\n**Incorrect Approach:**\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token')?.value;\n\n  if (!token) {\n    const res = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url))\n    res.cookies.set('redirect_to', req.nextUrl.pathname) // INCORRECT: This will likely fail\n    return res;\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is flawed because the `res.cookies.set` method after initiating a redirect does not reliably set the cookie.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\nThis improved version uses the `NextResponse.rewrite` method instead of `NextResponse.redirect`.  This ensures cookies are set before the response is sent.  We also handle setting the `redirect_to` cookie within the `NextResponse` constructor:\n\n```javascript\n// pages/api/middleware.js\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const token = req.cookies.get('token')?.value;\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/login', req.url), {\n      headers: {\n        'Set-Cookie': `redirect_to=${encodeURIComponent(req.nextUrl.pathname)}; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/',\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Fix:**\n\n1. **`NextResponse.rewrite`:** Instead of `NextResponse.redirect`, we use `NextResponse.rewrite`. This method allows you to modify the response headers before the redirect.\n\n2. **`headers` object:** We use the `headers` object within `NextResponse.rewrite` to set the cookie using the `Set-Cookie` header.  This is the correct and reliable way to set cookies in the response.\n\n3. **Cookie attributes:**  The `Set-Cookie` header includes important attributes:\n   - `Path=/`:  The cookie is accessible across all paths on the domain.\n   - `HttpOnly`: The cookie is only accessible via HTTP requests and not client-side JavaScript, enhancing security.\n   - `Secure`: The cookie is only sent over HTTPS, further increasing security.\n   - `SameSite=Strict`: This prevents the cookie from being sent with cross-site requests.\n\n4. **`encodeURIComponent`:**  This function is crucial for safely encoding the URL path to prevent issues with special characters.\n\nNow, the redirect to `/login` will successfully set the `redirect_to` cookie, allowing you to handle the redirect appropriately on the `/login` page.\n\n\n## External References\n\n* [Next.js Middleware Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n* [NextResponse API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server#nextresponse)\n* [HTTP Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n\n\n## Copyright (c) OpenRockets Open-source Network.
